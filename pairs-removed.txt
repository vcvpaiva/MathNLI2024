P: This paper introduces the notions of vector field and flow on a general differentiable stack.
H: The field of vectors contains a different stack of papers, but this one is the first to introduce the notion of a general differentiable stack.
Label: N

P: The axioms resemble those for monoidal Abelian categories with the addition of an involutive functor.
H: The axioms bear a very strong resemblance to those for monoidal Abelian categories, even with the addition of an involutive functor.
Label: N

P: Neither enrichment nor a complex base field is presupposed.
H: Fields in this paper are not complex.
Label: N

P: We describe a simplified categorical approach to Galois descent theory.
H: Up to this point, nobody has studied categorical approaches to Galois descent theory.
Label: N

P: Then we present three applications of groupoidification.
H: Earlier we presented four applications of groupoidification.
Label: N

P: The second application is to Hecke algebras.
H: The second application is to Hall algebras.
Label: N

P: We combine two recent ideas: cartesian differential categories, and restriction categories.
H: We combine three ideas
Label: N

P: We give a new proof of the fact that every topos is adhesive.
H: We conjecture that every topos is  also non-adhesive.
Label: N

P: Our main conceptual tool is a monad on the category of grouped toposes.
