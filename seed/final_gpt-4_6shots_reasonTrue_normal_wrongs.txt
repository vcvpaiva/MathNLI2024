1. Premise: If the category is additive, we define a sheaf of categories of analytic functions.
Hypothesis: If the category is non-additive, we define a sheaf of categories of analytic functions.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise indicates that the condition for defining a sheaf of categories of analytic functions is 
that the category must be additive. The hypothesis states that the condition for defining a sheaf of categories of
analytic functions is the category being non-additive. These two statements present mutually exclusive conditions 
for the same action (defining a sheaf of categories of analytic functions), leading to a contradiction between 
them. If one is true, the other cannot be true under the given conditions.

vcvp: traditional human error? A->B is not the same as A<->B
pk: "if not A then B" does not contradict "if A then B" 
LM: 1:  ChatGPT says

    If X, then Y
    
contradicts

    If NOT X, then Y
X= category is additive,
Y= we define a sheaf of categories of analytic functions
----------

2. Premise: We use these relations to define analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications of affine arithmetic varieties.
Hypothesis: We use these relations to define analytic versions of  compactifications of non-varieties.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise discusses defining analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications specifically for "affine
arithmetic varieties". In stark contrast, the hypothesis mentions defining compactifications of "non-varieties",
which directly contradicts the scope outlined in the premise. Since the premise is focused on a subset defined as
"varieties", asserting that the process is applied to "non-varieties" in the hypothesis contradicts the original assertion.

pk: "we use A to do B" does not contradict "we use C to do D"
vcvp: in this case "we use A to do B" does not contradict "we use A to do D"
LM: This is a similar problem to 1, actually.  ChatGPT basically aligns the Premise and Hypothesis, 
and if there is a discrepancy anyplace, it jumps on this and says 'Contradiction'.  In this case, it aligns as follows: 

We . . . . to define . . . X
We . . . . to define . . . Y

Since X and Y were different (they are even opposing concepts), it said C.
But a mathematical paper could do BOTH, and so this is why it should be N.
----------

3. Premise: These functors are used in the paper only to prove Corollary~8.3.
Hypothesis: These natural transformations are used in the paper  to prove Corollary~8.5.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions that "functors" are used in the paper only to prove "Corollary 8.3," 
while the hypothesis incorrectly states that "natural transformations" (which are related but distinct concepts 
from functors in category theory) are used to prove "Corollary 8.5." Not only does the subject (functors vs. 
natural transformations) differ between the premise and the hypothesis, but the specific corollaries mentioned also
differ (8.3 vs. 8.5), leading to a direct contradiction.

pk: "A is used to prove B" does not contradict "C is used to prove D"
LM: ChatGPT seems to be thinking that 'These functors' contradicts 'These natural transformations'.  I think most people mathematicians would rather think that the two occurrences of 'these' refer to different things. If I'm right, then what we have is a failure to accommodate the two "these"s.  If I'm wrong -- if most people would try to have a coreference between the functors and the natural transformations -- then this one would be non-sensical rather than neutral, I think.
vcvp: agree with both
----------

4. Premise: Here ``balanced'' can be omitted if the category is additive.
Hypothesis: Here ``balanced'' can be omitted if the category is multiplicative.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise specifies a condition under which the term "balanced" can be omitted, specifically if the 
category is "additive." The hypothesis changes this condition to if the category is "multiplicative." Changing the 
condition from additive to multiplicative alters the fundamental requirement for omitting "balanced," directly 
opposing the premise's stated condition. Thus, the relationship between these statements is a contradiction because
the condition under which "balanced" can be omitted is reversed, indicating that in the context provided by the 
premise, the hypothesis's condition cannot be true.

pk: "A can be done if B" does not contradict "A can be done if C"
vcvp: agree
LM: I also agree with this point.  It's again jumping to Contradiction based on a mis-alignment, and then justifying that in its explanation.
----------

5. Premise: We introduce the notion of mutation pairs in pseudo-triangulated categories.
Hypothesis: We introduce the notation of mutation pairs in monoidal categories.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions the introduction of "mutation pairs in pseudo-triangulated
categories," while the hypothesis incorrectly states that the introduction is about "mutation pairs in monoidal
categories" and also mistakenly refers to "notation" rather than "notion." Given that the subjects (pseudo-
triangulated vs. monoidal categories) and the context (notion vs. notation) differ significantly, the hypothesis
directly contradicts the specific content of the premise.

vcvp: 'differs significantly' (in the reasoning) does not imply contradicts
pk: "we do A" does not contradict "we do B" 
LM: agree with pk.   A paper can do both A and B.
----------

6. Premise: This result unifies many previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories.
Hypothesis: This result unifies all previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

The reasoning in this pair is that the premise states "many previous constructions" are unified by this result, 
but it does not claim to unify "all previous constructions." The use of "many" suggests a significant yet 
potentially incomplete portion of previous constructions, whereas the hypothesis extends this to "all," implying 
totality and completeness. This discrepancy between "many" and "all" suggests that the two statements directly 
oppose each other, leading to the judgment of contradiction.



vcvp: "A unifies many X" does not contradict "A unifies all X"
pk: GPT mistakenly thinks that "most" contradicts to "all"
LM: ChatGPT seems to think that 'many' CONTRADICTS 'all'. See also 16.
----------

7. Premise: The syntactic architecture of such interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams.
Hypothesis: The only way to encode the syntactic structure of such interconnections is by means of the visual language of wiring diagrams.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that the syntactic architecture of interconnections is encoded using the visual 
language of wiring diagrams, implying it's a method used for encoding. However, the hypothesis asserts that this 
is the "only way" to do so, which directly contradicts the premise by limiting the encoding method to just one,
without the premise specifying that it is exclusive. The premise does not exclude the possibility of other encoding
methods for the syntactic structure of such interconnections, so declaring it the "only way" creates a 
contradiction.

pk: "A can be done exclusively in way B" does not contradict "A can be done in way B" (some pragmatic assumption)
LM: agreed, and Pavel is more eloquent here than my point.
vcvp: "A is encoded using B" does not contradict "the only way to encode A is by means of B"
----------

8. Premise: Using these ideas, we also prove that magnetic monopoles form an abelian group.
Hypothesis: Using these ideas, we also prove that monopoles form an abelian group.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions that "magnetic monopoles form an abelian group". When the qualifier
"magnetic" is removed in the hypothesis to just "monopoles", it does not change the core assertion that these 
entities form an abelian group. 

(vcvp: what? removing the qualifier means that all bets are off, it changes the core assertion)

Since the defining feature (forming an abelian group) remains intact and 
unchallenged, the removal of "magnetic" does not negate or alter the truth of the premise. Instead, it slightly
generalizes the statement but still supports the conclusion that monopoles form an abelian group. Therefore, this 
relationship is an entailment as the hypothesis is a true assertion under the condition set by the premise.

vcvp: "using A, we also prove B" does not entail "using A, we also prove C"
pk:  Is the hypothesis ambiguous between the universal and existential reading? Is there a reading like "Using these ideas, we also prove that some monopoles form an abelian group"? If yes, then I think GPT is right.
LM: ChatGPT seems to suggest that it's okay to drop important adjectives!  
I thought that it could be saying that we have

  Using these ideas, we also prove that SOME magnetic monopoles form an abelian group.
  Hypothesis: Using these ideas, we also prove that SOME monopoles form an abelian group.
  
This WOULD follow.  But it's not how any mathematician would read this.
And it's also not what the explanation suggests.   The explanation says 'the removal of "magnetic" does not negate or alter the truth of the premise. Instead, it slightly generalizes the statement'.  That's consistent with the universal reading of the monopoles and magnetic monopoles.  Then the error is to assume that a generalization of a given sentence follows from that sentence.  Of course this is wrong in general.
----------

9. Premise: We introduce a 3-dimensional categorical structure which we call intercategory.
Hypothesis: An intercategory is a category with a 3-dimensional intercategorical structure.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise statement introduces a 3-dimensional categorical structure named "intercategory." The
hypothesis describes an "intercategory" as a category with a 3-dimensional intercategorical structure. Essentially, 
the hypothesis rephrases the definition provided in the premise, thereby directly following from what is stated in
the premise. Thus, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment, as the hypothesis
essentially restates the concept introduced in the premise with slightly different wording but equivalent meaning.


pk:  GPT is being sloppy with its reasoning. The premise doesn't mention that an intercategory is a category (but GPT is probably assuming this).
LM: this one is 'my bad'.  I think ChatGPT is correct, and its reasoning is on the right track.    The hypothesis talks about '3-dimensional intercategorical' structure and the premise about '3-dimensional categorical' structure.  In fact, the Hypothesis is kind of tautological.  It would be like 'A circle is a curve making a circular path'.  So I think ChatGPT basically got this one -- and its reasoning is not so bad. 
vcvp: if GPT4 is right we need a NEW neutral!
----------

10. Premise: This paper extends the Day Reflection Theorem to skew monoidal categories.
Hypothesis: This paper derives the Day Reflection Theorem from skew monoidal categories.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise indicates that the paper expands the scope of the Day Reflection Theorem to include skew
monoidal categories, suggesting an addition or enhancement to existing knowledge. The hypothesis, on the other
hand, suggests that the theorem is derived or deduced from the properties or existence of skew monoidal categories,
which focuses on the origin or basis of the theorem rather than its extension. While both statements involve skew 
monoidal categories and the Day Reflection Theorem, the premise and the hypothesis focus on different aspects of 
the relationship between the theorem and skew monoidal categories. Therefore, the relationship is neutral, as the 
hypothesis neither directly contradicts nor is necessarily entailed by the premise based on the information provided.

vcvp: is this really a contradiction?
pk: I think GPT is right, and this is N
LM: It's kind of non-sensical to derive a result from a category.
I still think it's a contradiction.  But I could imagine some results being both derived from and extending to the same other results.  Is that why you two think it's N??
vcvp: yes, I think some results can both be derived from and extended to the same X.
"A extends B to C" does not contradict "A derives B from C"

----------

11. Premise: We give an explicit construction of the category Opetope of opetopes.
Hypothesis: The category of opetopes was previously constructed by someone named Opetope.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that the construction of the category of opetopes is being given explicitly in the 
current document, which implies that this is the point at which the category is being constructed or presented.
The hypothesis suggests that the category was previously constructed by someone named Opetope, which directly
contradicts the premise that the construction is being presented now for what appears to be the first time. 
The premise makes no mention of a prior construction or of someone named Opetope being involved in such a construction. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.

vcvp: temporal reasoning?
pk: similar to 7, some pragmatic assumption (but in this case, this pragmatic assumption has to do with temporality)
LM: To me, the prior construction mentioned in the Hypothesis could be OK-but-not-really-explicit.  That is, I focus on the word 'explicit'.   The category could have been constructed before by using some high-powered tool that shows the existence but not in an explicit way.   If I'm right here, this is the reason for the Neutral label.  Now you two might think that I'm leaning too much on category theory experience.
vcvp: I thought we had banned temporal reasoning from this dataset.
but  GPT-4 is right when it says "The premise makes no mention of a prior construction or of someone named Opetope being involved in such a construction." and making no mention should point at neutrality, not contradiction.
----------

12. Premise: We take some first steps in providing a synthetic theory of distributions.
Hypothesis: We build on synthetic theories of many others in order to provide a synthetic theory of distributions.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that "first steps" are taken in providing a synthetic theory of distributions, but 
it does not specify whether these steps involve building on the synthetic theories of many others. The hypothesis
suggests that the effort to provide a synthetic theory of distributions builds upon many others' synthetic 
theories. However, because the premise does not mention reliance on or incorporation of other theories explicitly,
it leaves open the possibility that the work could be either independent or cumulative in nature. Therefore, the 
relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise does not confirm or deny the claim 
made in the hypothesis.

vcvp: again I think we had organized *not* to do temporal phenomena, these are more complicated reasonings than should appear in this set.
pk: I think GPT is right: we may be the first to be building "synthetic theory of distributions", and our first steps may involve other kinds of "synthetic theories" which were developed by "many others" earlier
LM:  If the Premise says 'we take the first steps', it doesn't mean "we take the first steps by building on others' work".  It contradicts that! (But I see that Pavel totally disagrees here, so I should think again.)

----------

13. Premise: We introduce various notions of partial topos, i.e. `topos without terminal object'.
Hypothesis: We also introduce various notions of topos with a terminal object.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that the introduced notions of partial topos are specifically defined as a
"topos without terminal object". The hypothesis directly contradicts this by suggesting that notions of topos with 
a terminal object are also introduced. Since having a terminal object and lacking one are mutually exclusive 
conditions in the context of a topos, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.

vcvp: agree that 'We do X', 'We do Y' does not give you a contradiction
pk: "we do A" does not contradict "we do B"; similar to 5
LM: A little like the problematic examples above, saying BOTH

    We do X
    We do Y
    
doesn't give a contradiction.

----------

14. Premise: In such a framework, the globular nerve always satisfies the Kan condition.
Hypothesis: The globular nerve only satisfies the Kan condition under very special assumptions.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise asserts that "the globular nerve always satisfies the Kan condition" implies that under this framework, there are no special prerequisites for the globular nerve to satisfy the Kan condition – it is a general property. Contrarily, the hypothesis posits that "the globular nerve only satisfies the Kan condition under very special assumptions," suggesting that its satisfaction is dependent on specific, probably uncommon conditions. These two statements are directly in conflict with each other, as the premise indicates a universal truth within the framework, while the hypothesis implies a conditional or restricted truth. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is best described as a contradiction.

pk: "A is true only when B is true" does not contradict "In framework C, A is always true"
LM: I think that the first sentence in the Reasoning is off.   The premise doesn't assert what ChatGPT says, it asserts it is IN SUCH A FRAMEWORK.  The next point, about the 'very special assumptions' is right.  But the end of the Reasoning is a curious mistake.  It says "The premise indicates a universal truth within the framework, while the hypothesis implies a conditional or restricted truth."  This is correct -- but it's not a contradiction!
vcvp: P: In X, always Y satisfies C.
      H: Y only satisfies C in very special conditions D.
----------

15. Premise: We give a categorical discussion of such results.
Hypothesis: We  give a discussion of such results using concepts drawn entirely from partial differential equations.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions a discussion of results from a 'categorical' viewpoint, which implies a focus on category theory or related concepts. The hypothesis shifts this focus to a discussion that is based entirely on concepts from partial differential equations. The shift from a categorical discussion to one based entirely on partial differential equations means that we cannot directly infer that one necessarily includes the other or vice versa. Therefore, the relationship between these two statements is neutral, as the premise does not give us enough information to conclude that the hypothesis must be true, false, or is directly entailed by the premise.

pk: If we're treating concepts as black boxes, then I think GPT is right, because without any external knowledge, it's impossible to know whether partial differential equations have anything to do with "categorical discussion"
LM: I think that ChatGPT and Pavel have a point.  My intent was to thing that concepts from PDE should be conceptually far from category theory.  That way, we get a contradiction.
I'm not sure how 'black-box-y' we want to be in this.
vcvp: agree that maybe we're using CT knowledge. let's change it.
----------

16. Premise: In many applications of quasigroups isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms.
Hypothesis: In all applications of quasigroups, isotopies are more important than isomorphisms.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise specifies that in "many applications" of quasigroups, isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms. This statement is not universal and implies that there are some applications where this may not be the case. The hypothesis makes a stronger, universal claim that in "all applications" of quasigroups, isotopies are more important than isomorphisms. By claiming this is true for all applications without acknowledging the cases where it might not hold, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise's indication that the importance is context-specific ("many" vs. "all").

pk: pretty much the same as 6 (maybe a bit more complex)
LM: as in 6, ChatGPT seems to think that 'many' CONTRADICTS 'all'. 
vcvp: agreed
----------

17. Premise: The problem of relating a factorization system to a pointed endofunctor is considered.
Hypothesis: A factorization system can be easily related to anything without any problem arising.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise discusses considering the problem of relating a factorization system to a pointed endofunctor, which implies active research or contemplation on this specific relationship. However, the hypothesis makes a general statement about the ease of relating a factorization system to "anything" without problems, which neither directly contradicts nor follows from the premise’s specific investigation into a relationship with a pointed endofunctor. Since the hypothesis generalizes beyond what is stated in the premise, making the relationship between the two statements neutral.

pk: I think the word "problem" is used in different senses in the premise and hypothesis, and if this is so, then GPT is right. In the premise, "problem" means "question", while in the hypothesis, "problem" means "a situation that causes difficulties"
LM: After reading Pavel's point, I think I buy some of ChatGPT's reasoning.
I buy the conclusion (Neutral), but I don't think that "the hypothesis generalizes beyond what is stated in the premise".  So I guess I don't think it's using the word 'generalizes' the way I would.  See also 23.
vcvp: I agree with Pavel that the two problems are unrelated, so cannot be in contradiction.
----------

18. Premise: The problem of relating a factorization system to a pointed endofunctor is considered.
Hypothesis: A pointed endofunctor cannot be related to a factorization system.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise is discussing the consideration or investigation into how a factorization system can be related to a pointed endofunctor. This implies that there is a possibility or an attempt to find a relationship between the two. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that a pointed endofunctor cannot be related to a factorization system, suggesting that it is impossible to establish such a relationship. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction because the hypothesis directly opposes the possibility presented in the premise.

pk: "A cannot be done" does not contradict "we consider the problem of A"
LM: Just because something is impossible doesn't mean that the problem of doing it can't be "considered" (raised).
vcvp: agree that GPT4 is wrong, this is not a contradiction
----------

19. Premise: This paper proposes a recursive definition of V-n-categories and their morphisms.
Hypothesis: This paper proposes a definition of V-categories.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise talks about proposing a recursive definition of V-n-categories and their morphisms, where "V-n-categories" refers to a specific form of categories, possibly including various dimensions or levels of complexity (suggested by the "n" in "V-n-categories"). Given that this specific type is a subset or a specialized form within the larger set of "V-categories", the proposal of such a definition naturally entails the proposition of a definition for V-categories in a broader sense. The specifics of "recursive" and involving "morphisms" do not detract from the entailment since proposing a definition for a more specified category (V-n-categories) inherently includes proposing a definition for the broader category (V-categories) which it falls under.

pk: this is similar to 9, GPT is assuming that if we define V-n-cats, then we will have also defined V-cats since it's a more general concept
LM: I think the 'n' is very much at issue, as is the word 'propose'.  The way I read things, the paper proposes the definitions related to V-n-categories.  But maybe the definition for V-categories (without the n) were already around.  So the paper need not propose them!  That's why I think this one is Neutral.
vcvp: hmm, this one is bad, because you're disagreeing about why it's neutral.

----------

20. Premise: The required simplicial approximation results for simplicial sets and their proofs are given in full.
Hypothesis: Approximation results for simplicial sets and their proofs
Label: neutral
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the required simplicial approximation results for simplicial sets and their proofs are given in full. This directly implies that approximation results for simplicial sets and their proofs are provided, matching the statement made in the hypothesis. Since all elements mentioned in the hypothesis are covered by the premise, the relationship is one of entailment.

pk: Is the hypothesis even a grammatical sentence? At least I've never heard the phrase "results for", where "result" is used as a verb. 
LM: The H is not a full sentence, so this looks like NONSENSE to me.
vcvp: we need a hypothesis that's a full sentence

----------

21. Premise: Subdivision behaves like a covering in the context of the techniques displayed here.
Hypothesis: Subdivision and other techniques do not mix well.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that subdivision behaves similarly to a covering in the specific context of the techniques discussed, which implies a positive or compatible interaction between subdivision and the techniques. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that subdivision and other techniques do not work well together, which directly contradicts the premise's implication of positive or effective integration of subdivision with the techniques displayed.

pk: "A and C do not mix well" does not contradict "A behaves like B in context C" 
LM: This is a kind of hallucination, guessing that the premise implied a positive value of something. 
vcvp: agreeing with both 
----------

22. Premise: This paper introduces the notions of vector field and flow on a general differentiable stack.
Hypothesis: This paper generalizes the notions of vector field and flow on a stack.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise indicates that the paper introduces (hence, defines or explains for the first time within its context) the notions of vector field and flow on a "general differentiable stack." The use of the term "general" implies an expansion or broadening of the notions of vector field and flow beyond more specific or previously understood contexts. This aligns with the hypothesis, which states that the paper "generalizes the notions of vector field and flow on a stack." Therefore, since the premise involves an introduction that inherently broadens these concepts, and the hypothesis describes this process as a generalization, the relationship between them is one of entailment; the premise's information warrants the conclusion drawn in the hypothesis.

pk: Similar to 9, but more severe. GPT is assuming that any "general A" is also "B", where A and B are distinct. 
LM: See my discussion of 2.  The paper could both introduce and generalize something.
vcvp:
----------

23. Premise: Both of them generalise the concept of algebra on a monad T.
Hypothesis: Both of them are special cases of a monadic algebra.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that both subjects generalize the concept of algebra on a monad T, which implies they expand or extend the concept. The hypothesis suggests that both subjects are special cases of a monadic algebra, implying they are specific instances within the broader category of monadic algebra. The transition from generalizing a concept (making it broader) to being a special case (narrowing down) of that broader concept shows that the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is not directly aligned. There's no explicit entailment because being a generalization does not necessarily mean they can't also be special cases, but there's not enough information to conclude that they indeed are special cases as described by the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship is neutral: the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis.

pk: I think GPT is right if we're treating concepts as black boxes.
LM: I take it that 'monadic algebra' and 'algebra on a monad' are the same.  Then I would think that 'generalization' and 'special case' are contradictory.   The 'reasoning' by ChatGPT says neutral about this, and I disagree.
vcvp: another difficult one, bc I'm not sure that 'monadic algebra' and 'algebra on a monad' are the same.
----------

24. Premise: We define eventually cyclic Boolean flows and the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow.
Hypothesis: The definition of the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow uses the definition of eventually cyclic Boolean flows.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise involves defining "eventually cyclic Boolean flows" and "the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow" together. This implies a relationship between the two concepts, specifically that the definition of one (the spectrum) likely depends on or incorporates the definition of the other (the flows). Thus, the hypothesis that the definition of the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow uses the definition of eventually cyclic Boolean flows logically follows from the premise, making this an entailment.

pk: GPT makes up non-existing relationships.
LM: this is reading too much in!
vcvp: "likely depends" is not "logically depends", no entailment.
----------

25. Premise: The axioms resemble those for monoidal Abelian categories with the addition of an involutive functor.
Hypothesis: The axioms are the ones of monoidal Abelian categories.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the axioms in question resemble those for monoidal Abelian categories but include the addition of an involutive functor. This means that while there are similarities to the axioms of monoidal Abelian categories, there is a critical addition—an involutive functor—that distinguishes them. The hypothesis, however, claims that the axioms are exactly those of monoidal Abelian categories, ignoring the specified addition. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it overlooks the important detail that differentiates these axioms from those of standard monoidal Abelian categories.

pk: The premise strongly suggests that the axiom of an involutive functor is not part of the axioms for monoidal abelian cats, and GPT takes this pragmatic intuition and attributes it to the semantics of the sentence. But this is a hard case even for humans, I think.
LM: I think that ChatGPT could be right here.  I focus on 'resemble' in the Premise, and 'are' in the Hypothesis.  Even setting aside the involutive functor, if we say 

X resembles Y
X is Y

I think most people would take the first as implicating the negation of the second.
(I know that in mathematics we might say that everything 'resembles' itself, but this is not the everyday usage.)
vcvp: I don't think that "most people would take the first as implicating the negation of the second." But even if the axioms were the same the premise would imply the hypothesis, not contradict it?
----------

26. Premise: A comparison to other approaches will be made in the introduction.
Hypothesis: Other approaches will be made in the introduction.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise indicates that a "comparison to other approaches" will be included in the introduction, suggesting that an analysis or evaluation of these other methods in relation to the one being discussed will occur. The hypothesis misinterprets the premise by stating that "other approaches will be made in the introduction", implying that the introduction will create or present new approaches, which contradicts the premise's assertion of making a comparison rather than presenting new approaches themselves.

pk: "Bs will be made" does not contradict "comparison of Bs will be made"
LM: The introduction could do both 'compare' and 'make' other approaches.
This is basically the same issue that we saw several times already.
vcvp: agreed

27. Premise: In the general case, no such meaningful partition could exist.
Hypothesis: In special cases, the partition is very meaningful.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that in the general case, no meaningful partition could exist. This implies that outside the general case, which can be interpreted as in "special cases," a meaningful partition could indeed exist. Hence, the hypothesis that in special cases the partition is very meaningful directly follows from the premise's implication about the exclusivity of the general case situation, making the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis one of entailment.

pk: "In the general case, B doesn't exist" does not entail "in particular cases, B exists"
LM: I think that it doesn't understand 'in general' correctly.   If we say 'in general' in mathematics, we don't go on to say "outside the general case" . . . That's one problem.  Even worse is the 'reasoning' that seems to suggest Entailment here. It looks like ChatGPT is suggesting Gricean implicature in its second sentence.
vcvp: agree

28. Premise: The present paper starts by supplying this last clause with a precise meaning.
Hypothesis: The present paper treats the last clause in an informal but meaningful way.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions giving the last clause a "precise meaning," which suggests a formal approach to defining or explaining it. The hypothesis suggests that the paper treats the clause "in an informal but meaningful way." Since the premise emphasizes precision (which is typically associated with formality) and the hypothesis suggests informality, there is no direct contradiction, but neither is there direct entailment because the two descriptions do not necessarily align in method. Thus, the relationship is neutral, as one cannot definitively conclude from the premise whether the paper's treatment is formal or informal—only that it aims to provide a precise meaning.

pk: Should it indeed be N? (And I don't like this hypothesis)
LM: I see "Since the premise emphasizes precision (which is typically associated with formality) and the hypothesis suggests informality. . ."
But I would go on to say Contradiction.  Why does it say "there is no direct contradiction"??
vcvp: I think agree with Larry that "precise meaning"  is in contradiction with "informal way"

29. Premise: Now coproduct preservation yields an approach to product measures.
Hypothesis: Now the preservation of product measures yields coproduct preservation:
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that "coproduct preservation yields an approach to product measures," which implies a directional causal or procedural relationship where coproduct preservation leads to insights or methods related to product measures. The hypothesis inverses this relationship, suggesting "the preservation of product measures yields coproduct preservation." This reversal directly contradicts the causal direction indicated in the premise, establishing that one process leads to the other and not vice versa.

pk: "A yields B" does not contradict "C yields D"; similar to 2
LM: I think here what we have is that 'A yields B' doesn't contradict 'C yields A'.
vcvp: agree 
A= coproduct preservation
B= product measures
C= preservation of product measures

30. Premise: We combine two recent ideas: cartesian differential categories, and restriction categories.
Hypothesis: The idea of restriction categories is not old.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that two ideas were combined, including "cartesian differential categories, and restriction categories," but it does not provide any information regarding the novelty or age of "restriction categories." The hypothesis makes a direct statement about the novelty ("The idea of restriction categories is not old") which cannot be inferred or contradicted based on the information given in the premise. The premise's focus is on the combination of two ideas rather than their individual histories or how recently they were introduced. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral because the premise does not provide enough information to affirm or deny the hypothesis.

pk: GPT just missed some information in the premise.
LM: ChatGPT evidently didn't read 'recent' in the Premise.
vcvp: agreed

31. Premise: The category of Set-valued presheaves on a small category B is a topos.
Hypothesis: The category of Set-valued presheaves on a small category C is a topos.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The given premise specifies that the category of Set-valued presheaves on a small category B is a topos. However, the hypothesis changes the specific category from B to C. The mathematical property mentioned (being a topos) could hold for categories B and C alike, but the change in the specific category from B to C means that the premise doesn't directly assert or deny the property for category C. Therefore, there is not enough information to conclude that the premise entails or contradicts the hypothesis, making the relationship neutral.

pk: GPT doesn't understand that B and C are not referential. (But in general, I don't like this premise, it's just a poor mathematical sentence: B plays no role here and should be removed.)
LM: Bad handling of variables.  We could probably ask ChatGPT questions to test its understanding of bound and free variables in mathematical English.
vcvp: agreed that is about names
----------

32. Premise: The category of Set-valued presheaves on a small category B is a topos.
Hypothesis: There exists a small category C such that the category of Set-valued presheaves on C is not a topos.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states a fact about the category of Set-valued presheaves on a specific small category B, identifying it as a topos. The hypothesis introduces the possibility of another small category C for which the category of Set-valued presheaves may not be a topos. The existence of a topos structure in the case of category B does not preclude the possibility of different structures or properties for presheave categories on other small categories. Hence, the premise and the hypothesis do not contradict each other but neither does the premise entail the hypothesis, making the relationship neutral.

pk: see 31
LM: Again it took B as a specific category, and a reader would take B to be a bound universally-quantified variable.
vcvp: agreed

33. Premise: Vertical arrows give rise to modules between representables.
Hypothesis: Horizontal arrows give rise to modules between representables.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise specifically states that "vertical arrows" are responsible for giving rise to modules between representables, implying a particular directionality or orientation in the process. The hypothesis claims that "horizontal arrows" serve this role, directly opposing the premise's assertion regarding the orientation of the arrows involved. Given that horizontal and vertical are mutually exclusive orientations (assuming a standard geometric or diagrammatic context where they are perpendicular), asserting one as responsible directly contradicts the claim about the other. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

pk: "A yields B" does not contradict "C yields B"; similar to 4
LM: another alignment error.
vcvp: agreed

34. Premise: Various concerns suggest looking for internal co-categories in categories with strong logical structure.
Hypothesis: We suggest looking for internal co-categories.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise mentions that "various concerns suggest looking for internal co-categories in categories with strong logical structure." The term "internal co-categories" is the focus here, which directly connects to the hypothesis stating, "We suggest looking for internal co-categories." The additional specification "in categories with strong logical structure" in the premise doesn't contradict but merely provides context to the suggestion, making the hypothesis a more general statement that follows logically from the premise. Therefore, the relationship is one of entailment, as the hypothesis encapsulates a core action or recommendation present in the premise without adding or altering the fundamental suggestion.

pk: There might be the same problem as in 8 with the bare plural. If it can be interpreted existentially, then I think GPT might be right (although there is still the question of whether "various concerns suggest ..." implies "we suggest...")
LM: I can see that this is one that reasonable people will disagree on. The way I see things, this one hinges on whether the 'suggest' is taken universally or not.  In the premise, I think it is naturally interpreted universally.  But then if we read the hypothesis the same way, we should not have an entailment.  ChatGPT says 'The additional specification "in categories with strong logical structure" in the premise doesn't contradict but merely provides context to the suggestion,' I agree with this.  But then it loses me when it goes on to say 'making the hypothesis a more general statement that follows logically from the premise.'  I would think since what is suggested is indeed more general, it does NOT follow from the premise.  If I said, 'I suggest that you attend [all] concerts given by famous musicians', it does not imply 'I suggest that you attend [all] concerts'.
vcvp: I thought the problem was with concerns versus "we".
