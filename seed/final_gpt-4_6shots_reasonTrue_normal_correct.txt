Premise: We use a number of interesting categories related to probability theory.
Hypothesis: There exists a number of interesting categories related to probability theory.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that "a number of interesting categories related to probability theory" are used, which directly implies the existence of these categories as claimed in the hypothesis. The use of these categories in the premise necessarily entails their existence, which is what the hypothesis is asserting. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: We use a number of interesting categories related to probability theory.
Hypothesis: There are no interesting categories related to probability theory.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that the authors use a number of interesting categories related to probability theory, directly contradicting the hypothesis' claim that there are no interesting categories related to probability theory. The premise affirms the existence of such categories, while the hypothesis denies it, making the relationship between the two a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We use a number of interesting categories related to probability theory.
Hypothesis: There are no interesting categories related to topology.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise discusses the existence of interesting categories related to probability theory but makes no mention of categories related to topology. Therefore, the hypothesis about the absence of interesting categories related to topology is unrelated to the premise's statement about interesting categories related to probability theory. Hence, the relationship is neutral, as the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis about topology.
----------

Premise: A notion of central importance in categorical topology is that of topological functor.
Hypothesis: Topological functor is a notion of categorical topology.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that a "topological functor" is a notion of "central importance in categorical topology," which directly implies that a topological functor is indeed a concept or notion within the realm of categorical topology. This direct implication from the premise to the hypothesis establishes an entailment relationship, as the premise provides sufficient information to conclude that the hypothesis is true within its context.
----------

Premise: A notion of central importance in categorical topology is that of topological functor.
Hypothesis: There are no notions of importance in categorical topology.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly identifies "a notion of central importance in categorical topology," which is the concept of a topological functor. This statement confirms the existence of at least one important notion within the field of categorical topology. Conversely, the hypothesis asserts that there are no notions of importance in categorical topology, which directly contradicts the acknowledgment of an important notion presented in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.
----------

Premise: A notion of central importance in categorical topology is that of topological functor.
Hypothesis: There are many  notions of central importance in categorical topology.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that a notion (singular) of central importance in categorical topology is that of a topological functor, implying that the topological functor is one such notion of central importance. The hypothesis suggests that there are many notions of central importance in categorical topology. The premise does not deny the possibility of other notions being of central importance, nor does it assert that the topological functor is the only notion of central importance. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the assertion that there are multiple notions of central importance in categorical topology.

Premise: In the nilpotent case, this nerve is known to be a Kan complex.
Hypothesis: There are nerves that are Kan complexes.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise specifies that in the nilpotent case, this particular nerve is known to be a Kan complex. This statement directly implies that there exists at least one nerve (the one mentioned in the premise occurring in the nilpotent case) that is a Kan complex. Therefore, the hypothesis that states "There are nerves that are Kan complexes" is directly entailed by the premise, as the premise provides an example that supports the hypothesis's claim.
----------

Premise: In the nilpotent case, this nerve is known to be a Kan complex.
Hypothesis: In the nilpotent case, this nerve is not known to be a Kan complex.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that in the nilpotent case, the nerve is known to be a Kan complex. Directly opposing this, the hypothesis claims that in the same nilpotent case, the nerve is not known to be a Kan complex. These two statements cannot be true at the same time since one affirms knowledge of the nerve being a Kan complex while the other denies this knowledge in the same context, leading to a direct contradiction.
----------

Premise: In the nilpotent case, this nerve is known to be a Kan complex.
Hypothesis: This nerve is not known to be a Kan complex.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifies a condition under which "this nerve is known to be a Kan complex", that is, in the nilpotent case. The hypothesis suggests a more general scenario, stating "This nerve is not known to be a Kan complex" without referring to any specific condition such as being in the nilpotent case. Because the hypothesis does not specify whether it is speaking about the nilpotent case or not, its statement does not directly contradict the premise, nor does it follow as a particular instance of the premise. Since the hypothesis could be referring to cases outside of the nilpotent scenario, the relationship is neutral. The premise's specificity to the nilpotent case does not allow us to conclude the truth or falsity of the hypothesis in general situations.

Premise: We worked through numerous examples to demonstrate the power of these notions.
Hypothesis: We worked through two examples to demonstrate the power of these notions.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "numerous examples" were worked through to demonstrate the power of the notions discussed. The term "numerous" implies a significant amount, which would naturally include at least two examples. The hypothesis specifically mentions "two examples," which falls under the scope of "numerous examples." Therefore, the hypothesis is a specific instance that is directly supported by the general statement of the premise, leading to an entailment relationship between the two.
----------

Premise: We worked through numerous examples to demonstrate the power of these notions.
Hypothesis: We did not work through numerous examples to demonstrate the power of these notions.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states, "We worked through numerous examples to demonstrate the power of these notions," while the hypothesis directly negates this statement by saying, "We did not work through numerous examples to demonstrate the power of these notions." Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is one of direct opposition, or contradiction, as both cannot be true at the same time.
----------

Premise: We worked through numerous examples to demonstrate the power of these notions.
Hypothesis: We worked through more than 20 examples to demonstrate the power of these notions.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that "numerous examples" were worked through to demonstrate the power of the notions discussed, without specifying how many examples constitute "numerous." The hypothesis specifies a precise number, claiming that more than 20 examples were used for demonstration. Since "numerous" is vague and can imply any number of examples, it does not necessarily include or exclude the possibility of there being more than 20 examples. Thus, the precise quantification in the hypothesis makes the relationship between the premise and hypothesis neutral, as we cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis based on the information provided in the premise.
----------

Premise: If the category is additive, we define a sheaf of categories of analytic functions.
Hypothesis: If the category is additive, we define a sheaf of categories of functions.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The hypothesis simplifies the premise by removing the specification of "analytic" from "functions," but retains the key condition ("If the category is additive") and the action ("we define a sheaf of categories of functions"). This simplification doesn't alter the fundamental claim made in the premise; it just makes it slightly broader by removing an adjective. The core action and conditional context remain the same, which makes this an entailment because the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise without adding, denying, or changing the premise's original meaning or conditions.
----------

Premise: If the category is additive, we define a sheaf of categories of analytic functions.
Hypothesis: If the category is additive, we do not define a sheaf of categories of analytic functions.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise asserts that a sheaf of categories of analytic functions is defined when the category is additive. The hypothesis directly negates this assertion by claiming that such a sheaf is not defined under the same condition. These statements are logically incompatible, making the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We use these relations to define analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications of affine arithmetic varieties.
Hypothesis: We can define analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications of affine arithmetic varieties.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise indicates that "these relations" are used to define analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications of affine arithmetic varieties. The hypothesis simplifies this statement by asserting the capability (or possibility) of defining analytic versions of these compactifications without specifying the method (i.e., using "these relations"). Since the premise provides a method for achieving what the hypothesis states is possible, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. Therefore, the relationship is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: We use these relations to define analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications of affine arithmetic varieties.
Hypothesis: These relations cannot be used to define analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications of affine arithmetic varieties.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that "these relations" are utilized to define analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications of affine arithmetic varieties. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by claiming that "these relations cannot be used" for such a purpose. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction, as they present mutually exclusive statements.
----------

Premise: These functors are used in the paper only to prove Corollary~8.3.
Hypothesis: These functors are used in the paper  to prove Corollary~8.3.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "These functors are used in the paper only to prove Corollary~8.3," which directly entails that "These functors are used in the paper to prove Corollary~8.3." The information in the hypothesis is a subset of the information provided in the premise, without adding or contradicting any details. The word "only" in the premise specifies the exclusivity of the purpose of the functors but does not change the truth of the hypothesis that they are indeed used for proving Corollary~8.3. Therefore, the relationship is entailment.
----------

Premise: These functors are used in the paper only to prove Corollary~8.3.
Hypothesis: These functors are not used in the paper  to prove Corollary~8.3.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that "These functors are used in the paper only to prove Corollary~8.3," which directly implies that the functors have a specific use within the paper related to proving Corollary~8.3. The hypothesis contradicts this by stating, "These functors are not used in the paper to prove Corollary~8.3." Given that the hypothesis directly opposes the premise's claim about the role of these functors, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.
----------

Premise: A proof of this corollary is given without details.
Hypothesis: There exists a proof of this corollary.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "A proof of this corollary is given without details." This implies that a proof exists, even though it may not be detailed. Therefore, the hypothesis that "There exists a proof of this corollary" is directly supported by the premise. The existence of a proof is affirmed by the wording of the premise, leading to the classification as entailment.
----------

Premise: A proof of this corollary is given without details.
Hypothesis: There is no proof of this corollary without details.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that a proof of the corollary is given, albeit without details. The hypothesis directly negates this by claiming no such proof (without details) exists. This direct opposition between the premise stating something does exist and the hypothesis claiming it does not exist constitutes a contradiction.
----------

Premise: A proof of this corollary is given without details.
Hypothesis: A proof of this corollary is given without a computer program.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that a proof is provided without details, which implies a lack of specific information or steps in the explanation. However, this does not necessarily mean that a computer program was not used in creating or aiding the proof, as the absence of "details" can refer to various aspects of the proof process not being disclosed. The hypothesis introduces a specific element (a computer program) that the proof lacks, which was not addressed in the premise. Since the premise does not provide information on the presence or absence of computer programs in the proof process, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. The two statements talk about different aspects of what the proof is missing, with the premise being more general and the hypothesis being more specific but not contradicting or directly entailed by the premise.

Premise: Here ``balanced'' can be omitted if the category is additive.
Hypothesis: For additive categories ``balanced" can be omitted here.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states, "Here `balanced' can be omitted if the category is additive." The hypothesis reformulates this assertion as, "For additive categories `balanced' can be omitted here." Both sentences convey the same information regarding the condition under which "balanced" can be omitted, focusing on additive categories. Since the hypothesis directly restates the premise with a slight reordering of words but without changing the meaning, the relationship is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: Here ``balanced'' can be omitted if the category is additive.
Hypothesis: Here ``balanced'' cannot be omitted if the category is additive.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that "balanced" can be omitted under the condition that the category is additive, meaning it's unnecessary or optional in this context. However, the hypothesis directly opposes this by stating "balanced" cannot be omitted if the category is additive, suggesting it's necessary in the same context. This direct opposition in claims about the necessity of "balanced" in an additive category makes the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We introduce the notion of mutation pairs in pseudo-triangulated categories.
Hypothesis: We introduce the notion of mutation pairs.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The hypothesis is a less specific version of the premise, omitting only the context of "in pseudo-triangulated categories." Since introducing the notion of mutation pairs in any specific context (as mentioned in the premise) entails that the notion of mutation pairs itself was introduced, this leads to an entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: We introduce the notion of mutation pairs in pseudo-triangulated categories.
Hypothesis: We cannot introduce the notion of mutation pairs in pseudo-triangulated categories.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the notion of mutation pairs in pseudo-triangulated categories is introduced. This directly contradicts the hypothesis which claims that it is not possible to introduce the notion of mutation pairs in pseudo-triangulated categories. Therefore, the premise and hypothesis stand in direct opposition to each other, making the relationship between them a contradiction.
----------

Premise: This result unifies many previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories.
Hypothesis: This result unifies some previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the result unifies "many" previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories. The use of "many" implies that it includes "some" as being part of "many". Thus, if a result unifies many constructions, it automatically entails that it unifies "some" of those constructions. Therefore, the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: This result unifies many previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories.
Hypothesis: This result is not related to any of the previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that "This result unifies many previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories," which directly implies that the result is significantly related to previous constructions. The hypothesis claims that "This result is not related to any of the previous constructions of quotient triangulated categories," which directly opposes the information given in the premise. This clear opposition in the assertions presented in the premise and the hypothesis establishes a contradiction between the two statements.
----------

Premise: We study extra assumptions on pretopologies that are needed for this theory.
Hypothesis: We investigate additional assumptions on pretopologies that are needed for this theory.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: In this case, the premise and hypothesis are expressing the same idea using slightly different wording. "Study" and "investigate" are synonymous in the context of examining or researching a topic, and "extra" and "additional" assumptions mean the same in this context. Since there is no meaningful difference in the assertion made by the premise compared to the hypothesis, this relationship is an entailment. Both texts convey the idea that there is an examination of further assumptions about pretopologies necessary for a certain theory.
----------

Premise: We study extra assumptions on pretopologies that are needed for this theory.
Hypothesis: However, we will not be concerned with extra assumptions on pretopologies needed for this theory.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that there is a focus on studying extra assumptions on pretopologies important for the theory, while the hypothesis directly negates this by stating that there will be no concern for these extra assumptions. The hypothesis contradicts the action (studying or concern) stated in the premise regarding the extra assumptions on pretopologies.
----------

Premise: We study extra assumptions on pretopologies that are needed for this theory.
Hypothesis: We do not study the basic assumptions on pretopologies that are needed for this theory.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise focuses on studying "extra assumptions on pretopologies" that are necessary for a specific theory under consideration. It does not explicitly address whether "basic assumptions on pretopologies" are studied or not. Since the hypothesis makes a claim about not studying the basic assumptions, which is not directly affirmed or denied by the premise, the relationship is neutral. This is because the premise's focus on extra assumptions does not inherently include or exclude the study of basic assumptions, leaving open the possibility that both basic and extra assumptions could be part of the study, or only one of them.
----------

Premise: We check these extra assumptions in several categories with pretopologies.
Hypothesis: We check these extra assumptions in at least one category with a pretopology.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the checks are made in "several categories with pretopologies," implying that the process occurs in more than one category, which inherently includes at least one category. The hypothesis narrows down the claim to "at least one category with a pretopology," which is a subset of the premise's scenario. Therefore, if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true, making this an entailment.
----------

Premise: We check these extra assumptions in several categories with pretopologies.
Hypothesis: We will not check these extra assumptions in categories with pretopologies.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that extra assumptions in several categories with pretopologies are checked, while the hypothesis directly states that these extra assumptions will not be checked in categories with pretopologies. This direct opposition between the premise's assertion and the hypothesis's negation establishes a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We check these extra assumptions in several categories with pretopologies.
Hypothesis: We check these extra assumptions in  categories with tensor products.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that extra assumptions are checked in several categories with pretopologies. The hypothesis, however, specifies categories with tensor products. Since tensor products are not mentioned in the premise, there's no direct contradiction or entailment. It's possible for some categories with pretopologies to also have tensor products, but the premise does not specifically say that all checks were done in such categories. Thus, we cannot conclude that checks in categories with tensor products either contradict or follow directly from the premise, making the relationship between the premise and hypothesis neutral.

Premise: Functors between groupoids may be localised at equivalences in two ways.
Hypothesis: Functors between groupoids can be localised at equivalences.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that functors between groupoids may be localized at equivalences in two ways, which inherently includes the fact that such localization is possible. The hypothesis simplifies this statement to assert that functors between groupoids can be localized at equivalences, without specifying the number of ways this can be done. Since the hypothesis accurately captures a possibility already acknowledged in the premise without contradicting or adding information outside the scope of the premise, the relationship is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: Functors between groupoids may be localised at equivalences in two ways.
Hypothesis: Unfortunately, it is not possible to localise functors between groupoids at equivalences.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that functors between groupoids can be localized at equivalences in two ways, which directly contradicts the hypothesis stating that it is not possible to localize functors between groupoids at equivalences. Thus, the statements are in direct opposition, leading to the label of contradiction.
----------

Premise: Functors between groupoids may be localised at equivalences in two ways.
Hypothesis: Localisation of functors between groupoids is used to prove Theorem 5.3.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise discusses the possibility of localizing functors between groupoids at equivalences in two specific ways. However, it says nothing about the specific application or usage of such localization, such as proving a particular theorem. The hypothesis introduces a specific application—namely, the proof of Theorem 5.3—that was not referenced in the premise. Because the premise does not confirm or deny the hypothesis's claim about the purpose of localizing functors, the relationship between the two statements is neutral.
----------

Premise: We show that both approaches give equivalent bicategories.
Hypothesis: Both approaches yield equivalent bicategories.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise and the hypothesis convey the same meaning using slightly different words. "Show" and "yield" are used to indicate that the result of applying both approaches is that the bicategories are equivalent. There is no change in the meaning or content of the statement, so the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: We show that both approaches give equivalent bicategories.
Hypothesis: It was shown that these two approaches give bicategories with very different bicategorical properties.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: If both approaches give equivalent bicategories as stated in the premise, this inherently means that the bicategories derived from each approach share common properties that qualify them as equivalent in the mathematical sense. Consequently, the hypothesis suggesting that these two approaches result in bicategories with very different bicategorical properties directly opposes the premise. The premise asserts similarity (equivalence) in outcomes, whereas the hypothesis asserts dissimilarity (very different properties), hence a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We show that both approaches give equivalent bicategories.
Hypothesis: Both approaches give the same bicategory.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: Two bicategories being 'equivalent' in mathematical terms does not necessarily mean they are 'the same'. In mathematics, 'equivalent' often means that two structures or entities have a similar form, function, or can be transformed into each other under certain conditions or mappings. However, 'the same' implies a stronger condition, that they are identical in every respect. Since the hypothesis asserts that both approaches give "the same" bicategory, it goes beyond what is implied by them giving "equivalent bicategories" in the premise. Therefore, this scenario is best described as neutral, because the hypothesis introduces a stronger condition not directly supported by the premise.

Premise: In this paper, we use the language of operads to study open dynamical systems.
Hypothesis: We study dynamical systems in this paper.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that the focus of the paper is to study open dynamical systems using the language of operads. The hypothesis simplifies this statement to "We study dynamical systems in this paper," which is broadly included in the study mentioned in the premise. Since the hypothesis is a less specific version of the premise and does not contradict any of its information, the relationship between these sentences is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: In this paper, we use the language of operads to study open dynamical systems.
Hypothesis: We will not be concerned with the language of operads.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the language of operads is used to study open dynamical systems, indicating it is a significant aspect of the study. The hypothesis directly opposes this by claiming that there will be no concern with the language of operads. Since the two statements offer directly opposing accounts regarding the importance and use of the language of operads, they contradict each other.
----------

Premise: In this paper, we use the language of operads to study open dynamical systems.
Hypothesis: The study of open dynamical systems requires the language of operads.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise clearly indicates that the language of operads is used in the paper to study open dynamical systems. However, stating that this study "requires" the language of operads, as the hypothesis does, introduces a sense of necessity that is not explicitly present in the premise. The premise does not claim that the language of operads is the only way, or even the necessary way, to study open dynamical systems, just that it is the approach chosen by the authors. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, nor does it directly contradict it.

Premise: The syntactic architecture of such interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams.
Hypothesis: Wiring diagrams are related to the syntactic architecture of such interconnections.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that the "syntactic architecture of such interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams," which directly implies that wiring diagrams are a method or tool related to describing or understanding the syntactic architecture of these interconnections. Hence, the hypothesis that states "Wiring diagrams are related to the syntactic architecture of such interconnections" is directly supported by the premise, making the label entailment.
----------

Premise: The syntactic architecture of such interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams.
Hypothesis: Such interconnections lack any syntactic structure.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the syntactic architecture of the interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams, which implies the presence of a syntactic structure. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that such interconnections lack any syntactic structure, directly contradicting the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.

Premise: Moreover it enables us to characterise operads as categorical polynomial monads in a canonical way.
Hypothesis: Operads can be characterised as categorical polynomial monads.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the approach undertaken "enables us to characterise operads as categorical polynomial monads in a canonical way." This directly supports the hypothesis that "Operads can be characterised as categorical polynomial monads," as it clarifies that such a characterization is indeed possible through the described method. Thus, the information in the hypothesis is directly entailed, or logically follows, from the provided premise, leading to the classification of entailment.
----------

Premise: Moreover it enables us to characterise operads as categorical polynomial monads in a canonical way.
Hypothesis: Operads can be characterised as categorical polynomial monads; however, no canonical way of doing so exists.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise directly states that it enables characterization of operads as categorical polynomial monads in a canonical way, implying there exists a canonical method for doing so. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by claiming there is no canonical way to characterize operads as categorical polynomial monads. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: Moreover it enables us to characterise operads as categorical polynomial monads in a canonical way.
Hypothesis: There is exactly one way to characterise operads as categorical polynomial monads.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that it enables characterization of operads as categorical polynomial monads in a canonical way, which implies a preferred or standard method but does not necessarily imply exclusivity or that there is only one possible way to make such a characterization. The use of "canonical" suggests a method that is widely accepted or standard rather than being the only method available. Therefore, saying there is "exactly one way" as stated in the hypothesis is not directly supported nor contradicted by the premise, making the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis neutral.

Premise: We have two useful gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree.
Hypothesis: There exist some gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that "we have two useful gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree," clearly indicating the existence of such gradings. The hypothesis merely claims the existence of "some gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree," without specifying the number or implying any additional properties beyond those mentioned in the premise. Thus, the hypothesis simply generalizes the specific case presented in the premise without adding or contradicting any information, leading to the label of entailment.
----------

Premise: We have two useful gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree.
Hypothesis: No two gradings which change the degree are isomorphic.

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that there are "two useful gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree." This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which asserts that "No two gradings which change the degree are isomorphic." Since the premise affirms the existence of such isomorphic gradings that change the degree, and the hypothesis denies the possibility of their existence, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We have two useful gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree.
Hypothesis: There exist many pairs of gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions "two useful gradings related by isomorphisms which change the degree," indicating a particular instance of such gradings. The hypothesis generalizes this to "many pairs of gradings" with the same characteristic. The shift from "two" to "many" does not directly contradict the premise but neither is it entailed by it, as the premise does not provide information on the total number or possibility of other such pairs of gradings. Therefore, the most appropriate label is "neutral," as we cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis based on the information given in the premise.

Premise: The result is a double category C//G which describes the local symmetries of C.
Hypothesis: The result is a category.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise describes "a double category C//G" which is a specific type of mathematical structure. By the nature of mathematical categories, a double category is a kind of category with more structure. Therefore, saying "The result is a category" is a general statement that encompasses the specific case of a double category. This means that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true because a double category is indeed a form of category, albeit with additional characteristics. This makes the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis one of entailment.
----------

Premise: The result is a double category C//G which describes the local symmetries of C.
Hypothesis: The result is a double category C//G which does not describe the local symmetries of C.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise directly states that the result is a double category C//G which describes the local symmetries of C. The hypothesis contradicts this statement by claiming that the result does not describe the local symmetries of C. Given that the hypothesis negates the key information provided in the premise, the relationship between them is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: The result is a double category C//G which describes the local symmetries of C.
Hypothesis: The result describes both local and non-local symmetries of C.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states the result is focused on describing the local symmetries of C, while the hypothesis expands on this by stating that the result describes both local and non-local symmetries of C. There is no direct contradiction, but the premise does not inherently suggest that non-local symmetries are also described, hence neither fully supporting (entailment) nor fully opposing (contradiction) the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral.

Premise: There are few known computable examples of non-abelian surface holonomy.
Hypothesis: There are some known examples of non-abelian surface holonomy.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise stating "there are few known computable examples of non-abelian surface holonomy" implies the existence of at least a minimal quantity of such examples, precisely aligning with the hypothesis that claims "there are some known examples of non-abelian surface holonomy". Since the hypothesis's assertion of the existence of examples is directly supported by the premise, the relationship between these statements is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: There are few known computable examples of non-abelian surface holonomy.
Hypothesis: There are no known computable examples of non-abelian surface holonomy.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that there are "few known computable examples of non-abelian surface holonomy", which directly contradicts the hypothesis that there are "no known computable examples of non-abelian surface holonomy". The presence of even a few examples negates the assertion of there being none, making the relationship between the premise and hypothesis a contradiction.
----------

Premise: There are few known computable examples of non-abelian surface holonomy.
Hypothesis: There are few known examples of non-abelian surface holonomy.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifies that there are few known *computable* examples of non-abelian surface holonomy. The hypothesis drops the qualifier "computable" and simply states there are few known examples of non-abelian surface holonomy. The absence of the qualifier implies a broader context in the hypothesis. Since the premise discusses a specific subset (computable examples) and the hypothesis discusses the broader set (all examples, computable or otherwise), it's possible that there could be non-computable examples known which are not referred to in the premise. Thus, we cannot definitively say that the premise entails the hypothesis, nor that they are in contradiction; hence, the relationship is neutral.

Premise: Using these ideas, we also prove that magnetic monopoles form an abelian group.
Hypothesis: Using these ideas, we also prove that magnetic monopoles form a group.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that magnetic monopoles form an "abelian group." By definition, an abelian group is a group characterized by the commutative property of its operation. Therefore, stating that magnetic monopoles form an abelian group directly entails that they form a group. The specification of the group being abelian only adds more information about the nature of the group, but does not negate the broader classification of forming a group.
----------

Premise: Using these ideas, we also prove that magnetic monopoles form an abelian group.
Hypothesis: Using these ideas, we disprove the conjecture that magnetic monopoles form a group.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that magnetic monopoles form an abelian group based on the given ideas. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that these same ideas were used to disprove the conjecture that magnetic monopoles form a group. An abelian group is a specific type of group characterized by commutativity of its operation. Since forming an abelian group proves that they do indeed form a group, the hypothesis contradicts this by claiming the opposite outcome (disproving they form any group), hence the label contradiction.

Premise: We introduce a 3-dimensional categorical structure which we call intercategory.
Hypothesis: We introduce a 3-dimensional categorical structure.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise clearly states the introduction of a "3-dimensional categorical structure" named "intercategory." The hypothesis mentions the introduction of a "3-dimensional categorical structure" without specifying the name. Since the specifics provided in the hypothesis (a 3-dimensional categorical structure being introduced) are fully covered and matched by the premise (introducing a named 3-dimensional categorical structure), the relationship is entailment. The hypothesis is a less specific statement that is directly entailed by the more specific information given in the premise.
----------

Premise: We introduce a 3-dimensional categorical structure which we call intercategory.
Hypothesis: We introduce a 2-dimensional categorical structure which we call intercategory.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that a "3-dimensional categorical structure" is introduced and called intercategory. The hypothesis presents a conflicting statement by claiming that a "2-dimensional categorical structure" is introduced and called intercategory. Since a structure cannot be both 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional simultaneously, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We show that these fit together to produce a strict triple category of intercategories.
Hypothesis: We show that these fit together to produce a category of intercategories.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions that what is being produced is a "strict triple category of intercategories." By the definition of categorial structures in mathematics, a "strict triple category" is necessarily a more specific instance of a "category." Therefore, if the premise asserts the construction of a "strict triple category of intercategories," it inherently entails that a "category of intercategories" is being produced. The hypothesis is a more general statement than what the premise conveys, but it is logically implied by the precise construction mentioned in the premise.
----------

Premise: We show that these fit together to produce a strict triple category of intercategories.
Hypothesis: We doubt that these fit together to produce a strict triple category of intercategories.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that there is a demonstration or evidence shown that leads to the production of a strict triple category of intercategories, implying confidence and factuality in this outcome. On the other hand, the hypothesis directly opposes this by expressing doubt about the same outcome. Doubting that something happens, which is stated as a fact in the premise, directly contradicts the information presented there, thus leading to a label of "contradiction".
----------

Premise: We show that these fit together to produce a strict triple category of intercategories.
Hypothesis: Three intercategories fit together to produce a strict triple.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions that "these" (without specifying the number) fit together to produce a strict triple category of intercategories. The hypothesis specifically mentions "three intercategories" fitting together to produce a "strict triple," without mentioning the category aspect. The discrepancy in specificity about the number of intercategories and the lack of mention of "category" in the hypothesis leaves room for other interpretations or additional information not covered by the premise. Therefore, it does not directly contradict nor does it necessarily entail the premise's statement, leading to a classification of neutral.

Premise: This is the third paper in a series.
Hypothesis: This paper is part of a series.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that this is the "third paper in a series," which inherently means that this paper must be a part of a series. Therefore, the hypothesis that "This paper is part of a series" is directly supported by the premise, making the relationship an entailment.
----------

Premise: This is the third paper in a series.
Hypothesis: This is the fourth paper in a series.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states the position of the paper within a series, declaring it to be "the third paper." The hypothesis directly contradicts this by claiming it is "the fourth paper in a series." Since both statements cannot simultaneously be true regarding the same series, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.
----------

Premise: This is the third paper in a series.
Hypothesis: This is the third paper on this topic.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that "This is the third paper in a series," which implies a sequence of papers, possibly on a related topic or methodology. The hypothesis, "This is the third paper on this topic," suggests that it is specifically the third one concerning a particular subject. However, the premise does not confirm that all papers in the series are about the same topic, nor does it deny it. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the series is dedicated exclusively to one topic based on the premise. Thus, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral: the hypothesis neither contradicts nor necessarily follows from the premise.

Premise: The effect of any bundle of Lie groups is trivial.
Hypothesis: Lie groups sometimes appear in bundles.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "The effect of any bundle of Lie groups is trivial." By mentioning "any bundle of Lie groups," it inherently acknowledges the existence of bundles containing Lie groups. Therefore, the hypothesis "Lie groups sometimes appear in bundles" directly follows from the premise's acknowledgment of the existence of such bundles, making this an entailment.
----------

Premise: The effect of any bundle of Lie groups is trivial.
Hypothesis: The effect of a bundle of Lie groups is non-trivial.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that "The effect of any bundle of Lie groups is trivial," which directly opposes the hypothesis that claims "The effect of a bundle of Lie groups is non-trivial." Since the premise affirms the triviality of the effect for any bundle of Lie groups, and the hypothesis directly contradicts that assertion by stating the effect is non-trivial, the relationship between these statements is contradiction.
----------

Premise: The effect of any bundle of Lie groups is trivial.
Hypothesis: Groups always have effects.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that the effect of any bundle of Lie groups is trivial, which specifically refers to a certain context involving "bundles of Lie groups." The hypothesis makes a broader, general statement that "Groups always have effects," without specifying any context or type of groups (e.g., Lie groups, within bundles, or in any other specific setting). The contrast in specificity and context between the premise and the hypothesis means that the premise does not directly contradict nor does it entail the hypothesis. Thus, the relationship between them is neutral since the hypothesis can neither be confirmed nor denied based solely on the information given in the premise.

Premise: All quotients of a given Lie groupoid determine the same effect.
Hypothesis: All quotients of a given Lie groupoid determine some effect.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that all quotients of a given Lie groupoid determine the "same effect," which implies that an effect is indeed determined by these quotients. The hypothesis is a relaxation of the premise, asserting merely that these quotients determine "some effect." Since the premise's claim about the sameness of the effect inherently confirms that an effect exists, it naturally supports the hypothesis that there is an effect, though not specifying any uniformity or uniqueness. This relationship is a classic case of entailment, where the premise's specific claim provides direct support for the more generalized statement presented in the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: All quotients of a given Lie groupoid determine the same effect.
Hypothesis: Quotients of a Lie groupoid determine different effects.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that all quotients of a given Lie groupoid have the same effect, indicating there is no variation in the effect determined by any of the quotients. The hypothesis directly opposes this by claiming that quotients of a Lie groupoid determine different effects, which contradicts the premise's assertion that the effect is the same across all quotients. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: All quotients of a given Lie groupoid determine the same effect.
Hypothesis: A Lie groupoid has either zero or one quotient.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that all quotients of a certain Lie groupoid lead to the same outcome, implying that there can be multiple quotients but their effects are indistinguishable. The hypothesis suggests a limitation on the number of quotients (either zero or one) but does not directly contradict the premise, as having one quotient could still align with the premise's assertion of identical effects. Furthermore, the premise does not specify the number of quotients, thereby making it neutral in relation to the hypothesis regarding the quantity of quotients a Lie groupoid may have.

Premise: Our analysis is relevant to the presentation theory of proper smooth stacks.
Hypothesis: Proper smooth stacks may sometimes be presented.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the analysis conducted is relevant to the "presentation theory" of proper smooth stacks. This inherently implies that proper smooth stacks have a framework or method through which they can be "presented" or described, aligning with the hypothesis that suggests proper smooth stacks may sometimes have presentations. The premise's mention of a "presentation theory" directly supports the possibility of presenting proper smooth stacks as mentioned in the hypothesis, thus leading to the label of 'entailment'.
----------

Premise: Our analysis is relevant to the presentation theory of proper smooth stacks.
Hypothesis: Our analysis does not have anything to say about the presentation theory of proper smooth stacks.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that the analysis is relevant to the presentation theory of proper smooth stacks, which directly conflicts with the hypothesis claiming that the analysis does not contribute or relate to the presentation theory of proper smooth stacks. Given this direct opposition in assertions, the relationship is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: Our analysis is relevant to the presentation theory of proper smooth stacks.
Hypothesis: Proper smooth stacks may always be presented.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that the analysis is relevant to the presentation theory of proper smooth stacks, which implies that there is an applicable theory or approach to possibly "present" these stacks. However, the premise does not assert or imply that all proper smooth stacks can always be presented; it doesn't guarantee the possibility or practicability of presenting every proper smooth stack at all times. The hypothesis makes a broader claim that goes beyond the information provided by the premise by suggesting a universal capability ("may always be presented") that isn't explicitly supported or contradicted by the premise. Therefore, the relationship is neutral because the premise neither confirms nor denies the hypothesis as it makes a more specific claim about the theory's relevance without asserting the universal applicability of presentation.

Premise: This paper extends the Day Reflection Theorem to  monoidal categories.
Hypothesis: This paper extends the Day Reflection Theorem to a family of categories.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the paper extends the Day Reflection Theorem to monoidal categories. The hypothesis states that the extension is to a family of categories. Since monoidal categories are indeed a particular type of category, extending something to monoidal categories implies extending it to a subset (or family) of categories. Therefore, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise because any extension to monoidal categories inherently involves an extension to a specific family of categories (namely, the family that includes all monoidal categories). This aligns with our understanding of "entailment" where the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: This paper extends the Day Reflection Theorem to skew monoidal categories.
Hypothesis: This paper extends the Day Reflection Theorem to monoidal categories.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions the extension of the Day Reflection Theorem to "skew monoidal categories," which are a particular kind of monoidal categories. The hypothesis, however, generalizes the statement to all "monoidal categories." Since skew monoidal categories are a subset of monoidal categories, the extension to skew monoidal categories does not necessarily imply an extension to all monoidal categories. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the hypothesis broadens the scope beyond what is explicitly mentioned in the premise.

Premise: We also give a presentation for FinRelk.
Hypothesis: We also exhibit a presentation for FinRelk.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that a presentation for FinRelk is given, and the hypothesis uses the word "exhibit" to convey the same meaning as "give" in this context. Since both sentences communicate the action of making a presentation for FinRelk available or known, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment. The change in verb from "give" to "exhibit" does not alter the fundamental meaning that a presentation for FinRelk is presented, hence supporting the judgment of entailment.
----------

Premise: We also give a presentation for FinRelk.
Hypothesis: There is no presentation for FinRelk.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that a presentation for FinRelk is provided ("We also give a presentation for FinRelk"). Contrary to this, the hypothesis claims that there is no presentation for FinRelk ("There is no presentation for FinRelk"). These two statements are directly opposing, making the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We also give a presentation for FinRelk.
Hypothesis: This is the first time that anyone gives a presentation for FinRelk.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise only states that a presentation for FinRelk is provided in the context of the current discussion or work, but it does not make any assertions regarding the history of presentations for FinRelk or whether it's the first time such a presentation has been given. Thus, without additional information suggesting that this is indeed the first time a presentation for FinRelk has been given, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the claim made in the hypothesis.

Hypothesis: We can define a bicategory from these modules and their modulations.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "These modules and their modulations then give rise to a bicategory", which directly implies that it is possible to define a bicategory from these modules and their modulations. The action of giving rise to a bicategory inherently entails the possibility and action of defining such a bicategory based on the given elements (modules and their modulations). Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is entailment.
----------

Premise: These modules and their modulations then give rise to a bicategory.
Hypothesis: It would be a mistake to think that these modules and their modulations give rise to a bicategory.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that "these modules and their modulations then give rise to a bicategory," affirming a direct outcome or result. The hypothesis directly opposes this statement by asserting, "It would be a mistake to think that these modules and their modulations give rise to a bicategory." Therefore, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, making "contradiction" the appropriate label.

Premise: These modules and their modulations then give rise to a bicategory.
Hypothesis: Every module and its modulations give rise to a bicategory.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that "these modules and their modulations give rise to a bicategory," which implies a specific set or grouping of modules and modulations has this property. The hypothesis makes a broader, universal claim that "every module and its modulations give rise to a bicategory," which extends beyond the scope of the original premise. The premise does not confirm nor deny that every single module and its modulation would result in a bicategory, thus the relationship is neutral. The premise provides information about a specific subset, whereas the hypothesis generalizes this to all possible instances, without direct evidence from the premise to support such a generalization.

Hypothesis: We give a construction of the category Opetope of opetopes.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that an explicit construction of the category Opetope is provided. The hypothesis also mentions the provision of a construction of the same category, albeit without using the word "explicit." The absence of "explicit" in the hypothesis does not negate or fundamentally alter the fact that a construction is provided, as indicated in the premise. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis since both assert that a construction for the category Opetope is given, with the hypothesis merely omitting the detail of the construction being "explicit." This omission does not change the core claim about providing a construction, thus leading to entailment.
----------

Premise: We give an explicit construction of the category Opetope of opetopes.
Hypothesis: It is an open question to give an explicit construction of the category Opetope of opetopes.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that an explicit construction of the category Opetope of opetopes has been accomplished. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which suggests that providing such a construction remains an unresolved or open question. Since the premise asserts completion of the task that the hypothesis considers not yet addressed, the relationship between the two is a contradiction.

Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the result includes "many known and new examples of quasitopoi." The inclusion of new examples of quasitopoi within the scope of this result as mentioned in the premise directly supports the hypothesis that this result encompasses new examples of quasitopoi. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment, as the premise logically leads to the conclusion presented in the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: This result encompasses many known and new examples of quasitopoi.
Hypothesis: This result is far from the topic of quasitopoi.

Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that the result is relevant and inclusive of both known and new examples of quasitopoi, indicating a significant relationship between the result and the topic of quasitopoi. In contrast, the hypothesis claims that the result is far from the topic of quasitopoi, directly opposing the premise's assertion that the result is indeed closely related to quasitopoi. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction, as their statements directly oppose each other.
----------

Premise: This result encompasses many known and new examples of quasitopoi.
Hypothesis: This result also implies new properties of quasitopoi.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that the result includes many known and new examples of quasitopoi, focusing on the existence or identification of examples. The hypothesis suggests that the result implies new properties of quasitopoi, which shifts focus to the characteristics or behaviors of quasitopoi rather than their examples. While the premise implies a broad understanding or expansion in the examples of quasitopoi, it doesn't directly state or imply that new properties of quasitopoi have been discovered or deduced as a consequence of the result. Thus, there's no direct contradiction, but neither is there entailment, making the relationship neutral.

Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that some "first steps" are taken in providing a synthetic theory of distributions. The hypothesis removes the qualifier "first" but still mentions that "some steps" are taken in providing a synthetic theory of distributions. Removing the qualifier "first" does not change the fact that steps were taken towards the provided goal, thus the hypothesis is entailed by the premise since the fundamental action of taking steps towards providing a synthetic theory of distributions is common to both statements.
----------

Hypothesis: We do not think it will be easy to take the next steps.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: Neutral

Reasoning: The premise only mentions that some first steps in providing a synthetic theory of distributions are taken. It says nothing about the perceived difficulty or ease of taking subsequent steps. Therefore, any statement in the hypothesis about the potential difficulty or ease of future work in this area is unrelated to the specific claim made in the premise, making their relationship neutral.

Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that a "partial topos" is a `topos without terminal object'. The hypothesis directly restates this definition of a partial topos as being a topos without a terminal object. Therefore, the information presented in the hypothesis is directly entailed or followed from the premise, making "entailment" the correct label.

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that there are "various notions of partial topos," which directly contradicts the hypothesis that claims "There is only one notion of partial topos." The premise suggests a plurality of concepts under the term partial topos, while the hypothesis asserts a singular understanding, hence they are in contradiction.

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that "examples for the weaker notions are local homeomorphisms and discrete fibrations." This matches perfectly with the hypothesis that lists "local homeomorphisms" and "discrete fibrations" as examples of these weaker notions. Therefore, the hypothesis is directly supported by the information in the premise, making this an entailment.

Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that examples for the weaker notions include "local homeomorphisms and discrete fibrations." This indicates that discrete fibrations are indeed considered as examples of the weaker notions mentioned. The hypothesis directly opposes this statement by asserting that "Discrete fibrations are not examples of the weaker notions," which is a direct contradiction to the information given in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.
----------

Premise: Examples for the weaker notions are local homeomorphisms and discrete fibrations.
Hypothesis: Local homeomorphisms and discrete fibrations are also examples of the stronger notions.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise provides information that local homeomorphisms and discrete fibrations are examples of "weaker notions." However, the hypothesis suggests that these examples are applicable to "stronger notions" as well, without stating whether these specific examples inherently qualify as stronger notions or if the premise fully encompasses the criteria for what constitutes a stronger notion. The premise does not explicitly state that these examples cannot be considered stronger notions, nor does it confirm that they are. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the information provided in the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis.

Hypothesis: Sometimes the globular nerve satisfies the Kan condition.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: If the premise states that "the globular nerve *always* satisfies the Kan condition," it implies that under all conditions or circumstances within the given framework, the Kan condition is met by the globular nerve. The hypothesis' claim that "sometimes the globular nerve satisfies the Kan condition" is a weaker statement but is entirely covered by the premise's assertion. Since the hypothesis's scenario (where the Kan condition is sometimes met) is fully encompassed by the premise's scenario (where the Kan condition is always met), this relationship illustrates entailment. The premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: In such a framework, the globular nerve always satisfies the Kan condition.
Hypothesis: In no framework does the globular nerve satisfy the Kan condition.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that in a specific framework, the globular nerve always satisfies the Kan condition. The hypothesis directly opposes this by asserting that there is no framework in which the globular nerve satisfies the Kan condition. This direct opposition in statements causes the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis to be a contradiction, as both statements cannot be true at the same time.

Premise: We give a categorical discussion of such results.
Hypothesis: We discuss a certain result mentioning categorical ideas.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise indicates that a discussion takes place about results using a categorical framework. The hypothesis narrows down this assertion by specifying that the discussion involves a certain result, which still implies the use of categorical ideas. Since the hypothesis is a more specific instance of what is broadly claimed in the premise without contradicting it or introducing unrelated elements, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: We give a categorical discussion of such results.
Hypothesis: We also give a categorical discussion of other results.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise makes a statement about discussing certain results categorically. The hypothesis introduces the idea of discussing "other results" categorically as well, which seems to expand beyond what is mentioned in the premise. Since "other results" could refer to different results not mentioned in the premise, the relationship doesn't necessarily contradict or specifically entail what is stated in the premise. Therefore, the most appropriate label is neutral, indicating that the hypothesis does not directly follow from nor contradicts the premise but introduces a possibly different scope of discussion.
----------

Premise: Another is to make clear which parts of the proofs of such results are formal.
Hypothesis: Parts of the proofs of such results are formal.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise suggests a purpose 'to make clear which parts of the proofs of such results are formal', directly implying that there are indeed parts of the proofs that are formal. Therefore, the hypothesis that states 'Parts of the proofs of such results are formal' is directly supported by the premise, making the relationship between the two statements an entailment.
----------

Premise: Another is to make clear which parts of the proofs of such results are formal.
Hypothesis: The proofs of such results are completely informal.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise suggests an aim to clarify the formal aspects of the proofs, implying that there is a recognition and presence of formality in the proofs' structure. Meanwhile, the hypothesis asserts that the proofs are "completely informal," which directly opposes the premise's implication that parts of the proofs have formal aspects. This opposition makes the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis a contradiction.
----------

Premise: Another is to make clear which parts of the proofs of such results are formal.
Hypothesis: Parts of the proofs of such results are informal.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise suggests the intention to clarify which parts of the proofs of certain results are formal. This statement does not directly imply that other parts of the proofs are informal; it could be interpreted that way but it does not explicitly state it. The premise focuses on establishing clarity regarding the formality of certain proof parts without making a direct statement about the existence of informal parts. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports (entails) nor contradicts the hypothesis.

Premise: In this case we recover the notion of a linear bicategory.
Hypothesis: We recover the notion of a linear bicategory.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The hypothesis directly restates the core action described in the premise without any conditions or additional context that could alter the meaning. Both sentences describe the recovery of the notion of a linear bicategory. The removal of "In this case" from the hypothesis does not change the truth of the statement given the context presented in the premise; therefore, the statement in the hypothesis is necessarily true if the premise is true, leading to an entailment relationship.
----------

Premise: In this case we recover the notion of a linear bicategory.
Hypothesis: In this case the notion of a linear bicategory cannot be recovered.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that "in this case we recover the notion of a linear bicategory," which directly contradicts the hypothesis that "in this case the notion of a linear bicategory cannot be recovered." This implies the premise and the hypothesis propose opposite outcomes regarding the recovery of the notion of a linear bicategory, making their relationship a contradiction.
----------

Premise: In this case we recover the notion of a linear bicategory.
Hypothesis: The notion of a linear bicategory has been recovered several times.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states a specific instance of recovering the notion of a linear bicategory, without mentioning whether it's a unique occurrence or has happened before. The hypothesis, however, suggests that this recovery has happened multiple times. The information in the premise does not confirm or deny the frequency with which the notion of a linear bicategory has been recovered, so the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral.
----------

Premise: The poly notions of functors, modules and their transformations are introduced as well.
Hypothesis: There exists a poly notion of transformation of functors.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise mentions the introduction of "poly notions of functors, modules and their transformations," which implies that these concepts, including transformations of functors, are part of what is being introduced. The hypothesis specifically states "There exists a poly notion of transformation of functors," which is directly implied by the premise since the premise includes transformations as part of the subjects introduced. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as it states a specific aspect (transformation of functors) that is covered by the broader introduction mentioned in the premise.
----------

Premise: The poly notions of functors, modules and their transformations are introduced as well.
Hypothesis: Nobody has ever studied poly notions of functors and their transformations.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise specifically states that "poly notions of functors, modules and their transformations are introduced," which directly contradicts the hypothesis that "Nobody has ever studied poly notions of functors and their transformations." The introduction of these concepts implies that they have been studied to some extent, making the hypothesis false in light of the premise.
----------

Premise: The poly notions of functors, modules and their transformations are introduced as well.
Hypothesis: The poly notions of rings are introduced as well.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise talks about the introduction of poly notions related to functors, modules, and their transformations, but it does not mention anything about poly notions of rings. Since the hypothesis introduces an entirely different mathematical concept (rings) that was not covered in the premise, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis cannot be classified as entailment or contradiction. The absence of information about the poly notions of rings in the premise leads us to classify this relationship as neutral. It's possible that poly notions of rings are introduced as well, but based on the information given in the premise, we cannot affirm or deny this with certainty.

Premise: In many applications of quasigroups isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms.
Hypothesis: Isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms in some applications of quasigroups.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that in "many applications of quasigroups isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms." The hypothesis rephrases this by saying "isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms in some applications of quasigroups." The change from "many" in the premise to "some" in the hypothesis does not alter the basic assertion that there exist applications where isotopies and homotopies are prioritized over isomorphisms and homomorphisms. Therefore, the hypothesis can be directly derived from the premise, making this an entailment.
----------

Premise: In many applications of quasigroups isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms.
Hypothesis: Isomorphisms and homomorphisms are always more important than isotopies and homotopies.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that in many applications of quasigroups, isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms. The hypothesis directly contradicts this statement by asserting that isomorphisms and homomorphisms are always more important than isotopies and homotopies. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.

Premise: Those classes are natural examples of reflective subcategories defined by proper classes of morphisms.
Hypothesis: Those classes are examples of certain reflective subcategories.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the classes in question are "natural examples of reflective subcategories defined by proper classes of morphisms." The hypothesis simplifies this statement by saying that "those classes are examples of certain reflective subcategories," without the specifics about being defined by proper classes of morphisms. Since the hypothesis is a generalized statement that is covered by the specifics provided in the premise without adding or changing the fundamental assertion that these classes are examples of reflective subcategories, the relationship is one of entailment. The hypothesis is unequivocally true given the premise.
----------

Premise: Those classes are natural examples of reflective subcategories defined by proper classes of morphisms.
Hypothesis: It is an open question whether any examples of reflective subcategories defined by proper classes of morphisms exist.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that there are natural examples of reflective subcategories defined by proper classes of morphisms, indicating that such examples definitely exist. The hypothesis, however, suggests that it is unknown or uncertain whether any examples of this kind exist. This directly contradicts the information given in the premise, hence the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is contradiction.
----------

Premise: Those classes are natural examples of reflective subcategories defined by proper classes of morphisms.
Hypothesis: Those classes are natural examples of several important phenomena that were observed by Grothendieck in the 1970s.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise talks about specific properties of certain classes, describing them as natural examples of reflective subcategories defined by proper classes of morphisms. The hypothesis makes a broader statement, saying these classes are examples of important phenomena observed by Grothendieck in the 1970s, without specifying what these phenomena are. Because the hypothesis introduces information that is not addressed by the premise, the relationship between them is neutral: the premise does not entail the hypothesis nor does it contradict it. The premise’s focus on a technical definition doesn't directly relate to whether or not these classes exemplify phenomena observed by Grothendieck.

Premise: The paper develops the previously proposed approach to constructing factorization systems in general categories.
Hypothesis: The paper focuses on constructing factorization systems.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly mentions that the paper is developing an approach for "constructing factorization systems in general categories." This indicates that the main focus or one of the primary objectives of the paper is indeed on constructing factorization systems. Given that the hypothesis simplifies this notion to stating that the paper "focuses on constructing factorization systems," it is reasonable to deduce that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise because the core focus outlined in both the premise and the hypothesis align directly. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: The paper develops the previously proposed approach to constructing factorization systems in general categories.
Hypothesis: The paper relies on no previous results.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: If the paper "develops the previously proposed approach to constructing factorization systems in general categories," it inherently relies on previous results or approaches that have been proposed prior to the developments discussed in the paper. The hypothesis claims that "The paper relies on no previous results," which directly contradicts the premise that acknowledges the utilization and further development of previously established approaches. Hence, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is one of contradiction.
----------

Premise: The paper develops the previously proposed approach to constructing factorization systems in general categories.
Hypothesis: The paper introduces the important notion of skew factorization system, which is helpful in constructing factorization systems in general categories.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: Neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that the paper develops a previously proposed approach for constructing factorization systems in general categories, but it doesn't specifically mention the notion of skew factorization systems. The hypothesis introduces a specific concept, the "skew factorization system," implying it as part of the paper's contributions to constructing factorization systems. However, since the premise doesn't explicitly talk about "skew factorization systems," there's not enough information to directly infer that the paper introduces or discusses this notion, making the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis neutral. The premise and hypothesis are related but without direct evidence in the premise to confirm or deny the specifics of the hypothesis, neutrality is the proper classification.
----------

Premise: The problem of relating a factorization system to a pointed endofunctor is considered.
Hypothesis: There is a problem of relating a pointed endofunctor to a factorization system.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise and the hypothesis both discuss the problem concerning the relationship between a factorization system and a pointed endofunctor, merely reversing the order in which these terms are presented. This reversal does not alter the fundamental issue being discussed; therefore, the hypothesis can be directly inferred from the premise. This makes the relationship between the two an entailment, as the essence of the problem described remains unchanged.
----------

Premise: Some relevant examples in concrete categories are given.
Hypothesis: Relevant examples in some categories are given.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise mentions that "some relevant examples in concrete categories are given," which inherently includes the notion that "relevant examples in some categories are given" as stated in the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a slightly reworded version that does not specify "concrete" categories but maintains the core meaning that relevant examples are provided in categories. This relationship is an entailment because the hypothesis accurately follows from, or is a direct consequence of, the information presented in the premise.
----------

Premise: Some relevant examples in concrete categories are given.
Hypothesis: No relevant examples in any categories exist.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that there are "relevant examples in concrete categories" provided. This directly contradicts the hypothesis' claim that "No relevant examples in any categories exist." The presence of examples directly opposes the assertion of their non-existence, establishing a contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: Some relevant examples in concrete categories are given.
Hypothesis: Some relevant examples in the category of topological spaces are given.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions that examples are given in concrete categories, which could include a variety of category types, such as the categories of sets, groups, vector spaces, and among them possibly the category of topological spaces. However, the premise does not specifically mention that the category of topological spaces is included; it only implies that examples from some concrete categories are provided. Since "concrete categories" is a broad term that encompasses many specific categories beyond just topological spaces, the premise does not necessarily entail that examples in the category of topological spaces are included. Therefore, there is no direct contradiction, but also no direct entailment, which makes the relationship between the premise and hypothesis neutral.

Premise: We characterize semi-abelian monadic categories and their localizations.
Hypothesis: We discuss some monadic categories.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise mentions a specific instance of discussing monadic categories ("We characterize semi-abelian monadic categories and their localizations"), which directly implies that some monadic categories are indeed being discussed. The hypothesis makes a general statement ("We discuss some monadic categories") that is universally true based on the specific discussion pointed out in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment, as the action of characterizing certain monadic categories necessitates discussing them.
----------

Premise: We characterize semi-abelian monadic categories and their localizations.
Hypothesis: Semi-abelian monadic categories lack localizations.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that semi-abelian monadic categories and their localizations are characterized, implying that localizations exist and are part of the study. The hypothesis contradicts this by asserting that semi-abelian monadic categories lack localizations. Therefore, since the premise indicates the presence and study of localizations which the hypothesis directly denies, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We characterize semi-abelian monadic categories and their localizations.
Hypothesis: We characterize abelian monadic categories and their localizations.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions the characterization of "semi-abelian monadic categories and their localizations," while the hypothesis shifts focus exclusively to "abelian monadic categories and their localizations." Given the explicit mention of "semi-abelian" in the premise, it cannot be definitively concluded that the work encompasses or excludes characterizations solely of “abelian” categories without the semi-abelian specificity. Therefore, without explicit inclusion or exclusion of one category type in the context of the other, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral, as the hypothesis neither directly contradicts nor is necessarily entailed by the premise.

Hypothesis: There exists a non-varietor satisfying Birkhoff's Variety Theorem.

Reasoning: The premise directly states that a non-varietor satisfying Birkhoff's Variety Theorem is presented. This directly supports the hypothesis that such a non-varietor exists, thus making it an entailment. The hypothesis is a straightforward representation of a part of the premise.
----------

Premise: However, we also present a non-varietor satisfying Birkhoff's Variety Theorem.

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that there is a non-varietor satisfying Birkhoff's Variety Theorem, which directly contradicts the hypothesis stating that no non-varietors satisfy Birkhoff's Variety Theorem. Hence, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.
----------

Hypothesis: We present three non-varietors satisfying Birkhoff's Variety Theorem.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions the presentation of a single non-varietor satisfying Birkhoff's Variety Theorem, while the hypothesis speaks about three non-varietors satisfying the same theorem. Given that the premise does not specify the number of non-varietors presented, merely stating "a non-varietor," it does not directly contradict nor necessarily entail the hypothesis that there are three. There could exist more non-varietors satisfying the theorem that are not mentioned in the premise, making the relationship neutral.

Hypothesis: Some categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: Entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "many categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements." Therefore, it directly implies that there are at least some categorical properties that exhibit this well-behaved nature when enlarged. Since "many" encompasses "some," the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment, as the premise provides sufficient conditions to affirm the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: It turns out that many categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements.
Hypothesis: No categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that "many categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements," which implies that there is a significant subset of categorical properties that exhibit good behavior when enlarged. This directly contradicts the hypothesis "No categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements" because the hypothesis claims the absence of any well-behaved categorical properties under enlargements, which is the opposite of what is proposed in the premise.
----------

Premise: It turns out that many categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements.
Hypothesis: All categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise indicates that "many categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements," which implies that a significant number of properties exhibit this behavior, but it does not indicate that this applies to all categorical properties. The hypothesis generalizes this statement to "all categorical properties are well behaved under enlargements," which could include properties not covered or implied by the word "many" in the premise. Therefore, there's not enough evidence in the premise to fully support the broader claim made in the hypothesis, making this a case of neutrality. The premise does not contradict the hypothesis, nor does it fully entail it; it leaves room for there to be exceptions.

Reasoning: The premise states that a completion of gms's by Cauchy filters of formal balls is described, implying that such a completion exists. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by asserting that no completion of this kind exists. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a clear contradiction.

Hypothesis: It is easy to describe a completion of gms's by Cauchy filters of formal balls.
Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states the act of describing a completion of gms's by Cauchy filters of formal balls without making any claims about the difficulty or simplicity of the process. The hypothesis injects an opinion on the ease of the description process, something that is not addressed in the premise. Therefore, there is no direct relation that allows us to conclude that the premise entails or contradicts the hypothesis, making the relationship between the two neutral.

Hypothesis: This paper is about a definition of V-n-categories.

Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise mentions that the paper proposes a recursive definition of V-n-categories and their morphisms, which logically includes providing a definition of V-n-categories as part of its content. Therefore, stating in the hypothesis that the paper is about a definition of V-n-categories is directly supported by, and follows from, the premise. This establishes an entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: This paper proposes a recursive definition of V-n-categories and their morphisms.
Hypothesis: This paper only discusses the definition of V-n-categories, not their morphisms, which will be introduced in a companion paper.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the paper proposes a definition of V-n-categories **and their morphisms**, directly contradicting the hypothesis that the paper only discusses the definition of V-n-categories, with morphisms to be introduced in a companion paper. This clear disagreement between the premise and hypothesis on whether morphisms are included in the discussion within the paper establishes the relationship as a contradiction.

Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that the result in question "relies heavily on some unpublished work of A. Kock from 1989." This implies that A. Kock indeed engaged in unpublished work related to the topic of the current work, as the reliance on his 1989 material makes clear his contribution to the subject area. Therefore, the hypothesis that A. Kock did some unpublished work on the topic of this work is directly supported, leading to the label of entailment.

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that their result "relies heavily on some unpublished work of A. Kock from 1989." In contrast, the hypothesis claims that their result "relies only on the published work of A. Kock." Since the premise clearly establishes reliance on unpublished work, while the hypothesis negates that by asserting dependence solely on published work, these statements are directly opposing each other, thus constituting a contradiction.

Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that their result relies on some unpublished work of A. Kock from 1989. However, the hypothesis broadens this scope by mentioning both published and unpublished work of A. Kock without specifying if any published work indeed is relied upon for the referenced result. The premise does not deny the involvement of published works, and the hypothesis doesn't confirm that the result directly relies on any published work. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the inclusion of published works as part of the reliance is either true or false based on the given premise, making the appropriate label neutral.

Hypothesis: Simplicial approximation results for simplicial sets are proved.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the required simplicial approximation results for simplicial sets and their proofs are given in full. This implies that simplicial approximation results for simplicial sets have been not only discussed but also proven, as included in the premise's scope. Therefore, the hypothesis that simplicial approximation results for simplicial sets are proved directly follows from the information presented in the premise, making this an entailment.

Hypothesis: The required simplicial approximation results for simplicial sets and their proofs are barely sketched.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise asserts that the simplicial approximation results and their proofs for simplicial sets are provided in full, which implies a thorough and complete presentation. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that these results and proofs are barely sketched, suggesting a superficial or minimal presentation. Since the descriptions of the extent of detail provided are mutually exclusive, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

Hypothesis: Subdivision can behave like a covering.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "Subdivision behaves like a covering in the context of the techniques displayed here." This implies that within the context of the discussed techniques, subdivision always behaves like a covering. The hypothesis simplifies this statement to "Subdivision can behave like a covering," which is a less strict claim that directly follows from the premise. Essentially, if subdivision behaves like a covering in a specific context (as per the premise), it is valid to conclude that subdivision has the capability (or potential) to behave like a covering, thereby making the relationship between the premise and hypothesis one of entailment.
----------

Label: contradiction

Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that subdivision behaves like a covering in the specific context discussed, while the hypothesis directly negates this by stating subdivision does not behave like a covering in the same context. These statements are opposites, leading to the label contradiction.

Hypothesis: We obtain exact sequences relative to a subfunctor of the identity functor.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that several exact sequences related to a subfunctor of the identity functor are obtained. The hypothesis simplifies this statement by saying exact sequences are obtained relative to the same subfunctor, without specifying a number. Since the act of obtaining exact sequences relative to a subfunctor of the identity functor is not disputed or altered in context between the premise and hypothesis, the latter can be seen as a direct, albeit less detailed, restatement of part of the former. Therefore, the relationship between them is one of entailment.

Reasoning: The premise explicitly mentions that "several exact sequences" are obtained, which directly conflicts with the hypothesis stating "No exact sequence...is obtained." Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction, as the hypothesis denies the outcome stated in the premise.

Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions that several exact sequences are obtained relative to a subfunctor of the identity functor. However, it does not specify what those subfunctors are, nor does it mention the product functor specifically. The hypothesis mentions an exact sequence relative to the product functor, which is a specific type of functor. Since the premise does not directly mention or imply anything about the product functor, it's not necessarily true that one of the several exact sequences mentioned in the premise is relative to the product functor, nor is it contradictory to the information given. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither directly supports (entails) nor contradicts the hypothesis.

Premise: The resulting notion of centrality fits into Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions.
Hypothesis: Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions has a resulting notion of centrality.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the "resulting notion of centrality fits into Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions." This implies that within the framework or scope of Janelidze and Kelly's theory, there exists a concept or notion that addresses centrality, as stated by the hypothesis. Hence, the information given in the hypothesis is directly supported or entailed by the premise.
----------

Premise: The resulting notion of centrality fits into Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions.
Hypothesis: Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions has no notion of centrality.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise implies that the notion of centrality is indeed a part of Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions, indicating that this theory incorporates, or at least is compatible with, a certain notion of centrality. Contrarily, the hypothesis suggests that there is no notion of centrality within Janelidze and Kelly's theory. These statements directly conflict with each other, leading to the conclusion that their relationship is one of contradiction.

Premise: The resulting notion of centrality fits into Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions.
Hypothesis: Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions has a notion of acentrality.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise indicates that the notion of centrality being discussed aligns with or is suitable for Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions. It does not, however, imply or negate the presence of a concept of "acentrality" within Janelidze and Kelly's theory. The hypothesis introduces the term "acentrality," which might or might not be part of Janelidze and Kelly's framework but is not directly contradicted or confirmed by the premise. Therefore, the relationship is Neutral since the premise does not provide enough information to either confirm or deny the hypothesis.

Premise: The centre of a monoidal category is a braided monoidal category.
Hypothesis: Braided monoidal categories can be centres of other categories.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the center of a monoidal category is a braided monoidal category. This implies that it is possible for a braided monoidal category to be the center of a monoidal category, as stated in the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise directly supports the claim made in the hypothesis, making the relationship between the two an entailment.
----------

Premise: The centre of a monoidal category is a braided monoidal category.
Hypothesis: The centre of a monoidal category is a monoidal category with no braid structure.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that the center of a monoidal category is a "braided" monoidal category, which means it inherently comes with a braid structure. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by claiming the center of a monoidal category is a monoidal category "with no braid structure". Since these two statements propose opposite characteristics of the center of a monoidal category, the relationship between them is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: The centre of a monoidal category is a braided monoidal category.
Hypothesis: A braided monoidal category has a centre.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that the centre of a monoidal category is a braided monoidal category, which means if you have a monoidal category and focus on its centre, it will have the structure of a braided monoidal category. However, the hypothesis suggests that a braided monoidal category has a centre, which might imply that all braided monoidal categories have centres. The premise does not necessarily imply that every braided monoidal category comes from the centre of a monoidal category or that every braided monoidal category must have a centre. There is no direct statement about the universal presence of centres in all braided monoidal categories in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral because the premise does not confirm or deny the hypothesis' claim about the general structure of braided monoidal categories.

Premise: Monoidal categories are monoidal objects (or pseudomonoids) in the monoidal bicategory of categories.
Hypothesis: The monoidal bicategory of categories has monoidal objects.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise directly asserts that monoidal categories are instances of monoidal objects (or pseudomonoids) within the specific context of the monoidal bicategory of categories. This statement inherently acknowledges the existence of monoidal objects within the monoidal bicategory of categories. Hence, the hypothesis that the monoidal bicategory of categories has monoidal objects follows naturally and is directly supported by the information given in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: Monoidal categories are monoidal objects (or pseudomonoids) in the monoidal bicategory of categories.
Hypothesis: There are no monoidal objects in the monoidal bicategory of categories.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that monoidal categories are examples of monoidal objects (or pseudomonoids) in the monoidal bicategory of categories. Therefore, the hypothesis that asserts there are no monoidal objects in the monoidal bicategory of categories directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.
----------

Premise: Monoidal categories are monoidal objects (or pseudomonoids) in the monoidal bicategory of categories.
Hypothesis: The monoidal bicategory of categories has  symmetric monoidal objects.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise describes monoidal categories as monoidal objects or pseudomonoids in a specific context (the monoidal bicategory of categories). However, the hypothesis discusses the presence of symmetric monoidal objects within the monoidal bicategory of categories without specifically linking this attribute to monoidal categories or indicating that these symmetric monoidal objects are equivalent or related to monoidal categories as defined in the premise. Since the hypothesis introduces an attribute (symmetry) that is not discussed in the premise and does not directly contradict or follow from the premise, the relationship is neutral; the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis.

Premise: Some properties and sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined.
Hypothesis: Sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "Some properties and sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined." This implies that among other things, the sufficient conditions for the existence of the construction are indeed examined, which is precisely what the hypothesis states: "Sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined." Therefore, the hypothesis is a direct subset of the information provided in the premise, leading to the label of entailment.
----------

Premise: Some properties and sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined.
Hypothesis: The construction has no properties.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that properties (along with sufficient conditions for the existence) of the construction are examined, which implies that the construction has properties. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by claiming that the construction has no properties. Therefore, the correct relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is contradiction.
----------

Premise: Some properties and sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined.
Hypothesis: We show precisely when the construction exists.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions that "some properties and sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined," which implies a degree of investigation into what makes the construction possible. However, it does not commit to the premise having shown "precisely when the construction exists." The premise indicates an examination or exploration rather than a definitive conclusion on the precise conditions of existence. Thus, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral since the premise does not necessarily entail nor contradict the statement that precise conditions of existence are shown.

Premise: Having many corollaries, this was an extremely useful result.
Hypothesis: This result has at least two corollaries.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states "Having many corollaries," which implies that there are at least two corollaries because "many" necessitates more than one. Therefore, the hypothesis that "This result has at least two corollaries" is a direct inference from the premise's assertion that the result has "many corollaries." Hence, the relationship is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: Having many corollaries, this was an extremely useful result.
Hypothesis: The corollaries made this result useless.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise indicates that the result was "extremely useful" because it had many corollaries. In direct opposition, the hypothesis claims that the corollaries made this result "useless." These statements are contradicting because asserting a result's usefulness is directly opposed to claiming it is useless.
----------

Premise: Having many corollaries, this was an extremely useful result.
Hypothesis: This useful result had no precedents.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that the result had several useful outcomes ("many corollaries"), highlighting its utility. However, the information about whether the result had any precedents or not is not provided. The term "precedents" refers to whether similar results or findings existed before this one. Thus, while the premise describes the result's utility and outcomes (corollaries), it does not address the novelty or uniqueness of the result in relation to previous work. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise does not inform us about the existence or absence of precedents.

Premise: This paper introduces the notions of vector field and flow on a general differentiable stack.
Hypothesis: This paper introduces the notion of vector field on a general differentiable stack.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise mentions that the paper introduces the notions of both "vector field" and "flow" on a general differentiable stack. The hypothesis specifically mentions the introduction of the notion of a "vector field" on a general differentiable stack, which is a subset of what is introduced in the premise. Since the premise explicitly supports the claim made in the hypothesis (about the introduction of the notion of a vector field), without any contradiction or additional unrelated information, the correct relationship is entailment.
----------

Premise: This paper introduces the notions of vector field and flow on a general differentiable stack.
Hypothesis: Vector fields on a differentiable stack are undefinable.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that the notions of vector field and flow on a general differentiable stack are introduced in the paper, which implies that these concepts are definable within the context of a differentiable stack. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by asserting that vector fields on a differentiable stack are undefinable. Thus, these two statements are in direct opposition, making the correct label contradiction.

Premise: Both of them generalise the concept of algebra on a monad T.
Hypothesis: The concept of algebra on a monad T is more special than both of them.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "both of them generalise the concept of algebra on a monad T," which implies that the original concept of algebra on a monad T is a particular case or is more specific compared to the generalisations introduced by "both of them." Therefore, the hypothesis that "The concept of algebra on a monad T is more special than both of them" is logically consistent with the information provided in the premise, making the relationship one of entailment.
----------

Premise: Both of them generalise the concept of algebra on a monad T.
Hypothesis: Both concepts are interesting.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise talks about the generalization of the concept of algebra on a monad T by both items under discussion. The hypothesis asserts that both concepts are interesting. The premise does not provide any information regarding the interestingness or value of the concepts, only their relationship to the concept of algebra on a monad T. Therefore, the relationship between the generalization of these concepts and them being interesting is not directly connected in the information provided. Hence, the relationship is neutral as the hypothesis neither follows directly from nor contradicts the premise.

Premise: We define eventually cyclic Boolean flows and the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow.
Hypothesis: We define the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow and also eventually cyclic Boolean flows.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise and hypothesis articulate the same concepts but in reversed order. Both statements mention the definition of "eventually cyclic Boolean flows" and the "eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow". The reversal of the order in which these concepts are presented does not alter the meaning or the content being conveyed. Hence, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as both convey the establishment of the same set of definitions.
----------

Premise: We define eventually cyclic Boolean flows and the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow.
Hypothesis: Without defining them, we use the concepts of an eventually cyclic Boolean flow and the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that "We define eventually cyclic Boolean flows and the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow," indicating that these concepts are being introduced and defined within the context provided. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that these concepts are used without being defined. This directly contradicts the premise, which confirms that definitions are provided for these concepts. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction, as the actions described in the hypothesis (using concepts without defining them) cannot occur if the premise (defining the concepts) is true.
----------

Premise: The axioms resemble those for monoidal Abelian categories with the addition of an involutive functor.
Hypothesis: The axioms are similar to those for monoidal Abelian categories, but we also make us of a functor which is involutive.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the premise with slight rephrasing. Both statements convey that the axioms in question are alike to those found in monoidal Abelian categories with the notable incorporation of an involutive functor. The hypothesis maintains the core information provided in the premise without introducing any contradictory or additional unrelated elements, thus establishing an entailment relationship.
----------

Premise: The axioms resemble those for monoidal Abelian categories with the addition of an involutive functor.
Hypothesis: The axioms have a very different flavor from those for monoidal Abelian categories with involutive functors.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that the axioms resemble those for monoidal Abelian categories, with the main difference being the addition of an involutive functor. This implies a similarity in the framework or structure of the axioms to those of monoidal Abelian categories, just with a specific added component. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that the axioms have a very different flavor from those for monoidal Abelian categories with involutive functors, suggesting a significant difference or divergence in the nature or essence of the axioms. Therefore, because the premise implies similarity (with an additional component) while the hypothesis suggests significant difference, these two statements directly contradict each other.

Premise: Neither enrichment nor a complex base field is presupposed.
Hypothesis: A complex base field is not presupposed.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly mentions that "Neither enrichment nor a complex base field is presupposed." This directly means that the conditions for both enrichment and a complex base field not being presupposed are met. Therefore, when the hypothesis states "A complex base field is not presupposed," it directly follows from the premise, making the relationship one of entailment.
----------

Premise: Neither enrichment nor a complex base field is presupposed.
Hypothesis: A complex base field is presupposed.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that "Neither enrichment nor a complex base field is presupposed," which directly contradicts the hypothesis that claims "A complex base field is presupposed." Since the hypothesis claims the exact opposite of what is stated in the premise, the relationship between them is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: Neither enrichment nor a complex base field is presupposed.
Hypothesis: The base field assumed is the real numbers.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that there is neither enrichment nor an assumption about a complex base field; it does not explicitly make any assumption about what the base field is. The hypothesis implies that the base field is assumed to be the real numbers. Since the premise does not provide information about the base field being real or otherwise, the claim that the real numbers are assumed is not directly contradicted nor entailed by the premise. Hence, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral, as the premise's lack of specification on the base field leaves room for various possibilities including, but not limited to, the real numbers.

Premise: A comparison to other approaches will be made in the introduction.
Hypothesis: In the introduction, we compare our work to that work in other papers.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that there will be a comparison to other approaches in the introduction. The hypothesis rephrases this by stating "we compare our work to that work in other papers" in the introduction, which essentially means the same as comparing to other approaches. Therefore, the information given in the hypothesis is directly entailed by the premise, making "entailment" the correct label.
----------

Premise: A comparison to other approaches will be made in the introduction.
Hypothesis: We decided to omit an introduction and instead discuss other approaches.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that a comparison to other approaches will be made specifically in the introduction, implying the presence of an introduction section that includes this comparison. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by claiming that an introduction was omitted and discussion of other approaches placed elsewhere. Since the hypothesis negates the existence or inclusion of an introduction that was clearly mentioned in the premise, the relationship between the two statements is a contradiction.

Premise: Distributive laws between monads (triples) were defined by Jon Beck in the 1960s.
Hypothesis: Jon Beck defined distributive laws between triples.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that "Distributive laws between monads (triples) were defined by Jon Beck in the 1960s." Given that "monads" are also referred to as "triples" in the premise, the hypothesis that "Jon Beck defined distributive laws between triples" directly follows from the premise without adding or assuming additional information. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: Distributive laws between monads (triples) were defined by Jon Beck in the 1960s.
Hypothesis: Jon Beck failed to define distributive laws between monads (triples) in the 1960s.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that Jon Beck defined distributive laws between monads (triples) in the 1960s, directly contradicting the hypothesis that Jon Beck failed to define these laws in the 1960s. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: Distributive laws between monads (triples) were defined by Jon Beck in the 1960s.
Hypothesis: The main point of Jon Beck's paper was to generalize distributive laws from arithmetic to monads (triples).
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that Jon Beck defined distributive laws between monads (triples) in the 1960s, but it does not specify what the main point or goal of Jon Beck's work was, especially in regard to generalizing these laws from arithmetic. While the hypothesis presents a plausible interpretation of what Beck might have aimed to achieve, the premise itself does not contain enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis. Therefore, without explicit evidence in the premise to support the specific claim made in the hypothesis about the generalization from arithmetic, the relationship is neutral.

Premise: For such a class of spaces homotopy orthogonality implies enriched orthogonality.
Hypothesis: For such a class of spaces enriched orthogonality is implied by homotopy orthogonality.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The hypothesis is a direct restatement of the premise with the clauses reversed in order. Both statements convey that within a specified class of spaces, if homotopy orthogonality is present, then enriched orthogonality follows as a result. Thus, the hypothesis is logically contained within, or entailed by, the information provided in the premise.
----------

Premise: For such a class of spaces homotopy orthogonality implies enriched orthogonality.
Hypothesis: For such a class of spaces homotopy orthogonality implies and also contradicts enriched orthogonality.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that homotopy orthogonality implies enriched orthogonality for a class of spaces, suggesting a direct relationship or compatibility between the two types of orthogonality within this context. On the contrary, the hypothesis asserts that homotopy orthogonality simultaneously implies and contradicts enriched orthogonality, which is logically inconsistent with the premise. This inherent contradiction between the premise's assertion of a compatible relationship and the hypothesis's claim of both compatibility and contradiction makes the correct label for this pair "contradiction."

Hypothesis: For such a class of spaces enriched orthogonality implies homotopy orthogonality.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that homotopy orthogonality implies enriched orthogonality, but the hypothesis inverts this relationship, suggesting that enriched orthogonality implies homotopy orthogonality. The reverse does not necessarily follow from the original statement; just because A implies B does not mean that B implies A. This lack of bidirectionality makes the relationship neutral, as the hypothesis neither directly contradicts nor is necessarily entailed by the premise.

Premise: The state space of a machine admits the structure of time.
Hypothesis: The state space of a machine has a temporal structure.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "the state space of a machine admits the structure of time," which essentially means that the state space incorporates or is organized in accordance with time. The hypothesis restates this by saying "the state space of a machine has a temporal structure," which is synonymous with the premise's assertion that the state space is structured around time. Therefore, the premise directly entails the hypothesis as both statements convey the same idea using different wording.
----------

Premise: The state space of a machine admits the structure of time.
Hypothesis: The state space of a machine is static.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: If the state space of a machine "admits the structure of time," it implies that the state space is dynamic and changes over time or involves considerations of time. The hypothesis stating that the state space is "static" directly opposes this by suggesting that the state space does not change over time or does not involve time considerations. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: The state space of a machine admits the structure of time.
Hypothesis: Like time itself, the state space of a machine has loops.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions that the state space of a machine has a structure that admits the concept of time but does not explicitly describe the nature of that structure, specifically whether it includes loops or cyclic behaviors analogous to "like time itself." While time is often conceptualized as having cycles (e.g., days, seasons), the original statement does not directly state or imply that the state space includes such loops. Therefore, because the hypothesis introduces a specific structural feature (loops) that is not explicitly contained or contradicted in the premise, the relationship is neutral.

Premise: In the general case, no such meaningful partition could exist.
Hypothesis: In general case, no such meaningful partition exists.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "In the general case, no such meaningful partition could exist," which suggests a general impossibility or non-existence of a meaningful partition. The hypothesis makes a similar claim, stating "In general case, no such meaningful partition exists." Both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same idea that it's generally not possible to have such a meaningful partition. The hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the premise with slightly different wording but without altering the core meaning. Hence, this is an example of entailment, where the hypothesis logically follows from and is supported by the premise.
----------

Premise: In the general case, no such meaningful partition could exist.
Hypothesis: There is a meaningful partition in general.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that, in the general case, no meaningful partition could exist. This directly contradicts the hypothesis that claims there is a meaningful partition in general. Since the hypothesis directly opposes the assertion made in the premise, the relationship is one of contradiction.

Premise: The present paper starts by supplying this last clause with a precise meaning.
Hypothesis: The present paper supplies a precise meaning to this last clause.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the present paper begins by giving a precise meaning to "this last clause." The hypothesis is restating this by saying the paper "supplies a precise meaning to this last clause." Both sentences convey that the action of supplying a precise meaning to the clause is done by the current paper, without adding any condition or limitation. Thus, the hypothesis is directly supported by the premise, leading to the label of entailment.
----------

Premise: The present paper starts by supplying this last clause with a precise meaning.
Hypothesis: The precise meaning of the last clause is given in the beginning and the end of this paper.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise indicates that the paper begins by providing a precise meaning for the last clause, but it does not specify whether or not the precise meaning is also given or revisited at the end of the paper. Hence, the hypothesis that states the precise meaning is given "in the beginning and the end" extends beyond what is explicitly stated in the premise. This absence of definitive evidence that the end of the paper revisits or provides the precise meaning as well makes the relationship between the premise and hypothesis neutral.

Premise: Under condition (I), every multiplicative graph is an internal category.
Hypothesis: Under condition (I), every multiplicative graph is a category.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that under a certain condition (condition I), every multiplicative graph becomes an "internal category." Therefore, since an internal category is a specific kind of category structured within another category, this means that every multiplicative graph, in this context, qualifies as a category. The hypothesis simplifies this assertion by omitting the term "internal," but this does not change the fundamental relationship: being an internal category entails being a category. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment.
----------

Premise: Under condition (I), every multiplicative graph is an internal category.
Hypothesis: Under condition (I), there exists a multiplicative graph that is not a category.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that under condition (I), every multiplicative graph qualifies as or becomes an internal category. This implies a universal inclusion of multiplicative graphs under condition (I) within the category of internal categories, without exception. Therefore, stating in the hypothesis that there exists a multiplicative graph under the same condition (I) that does not qualify as a category directly contradicts the universally inclusive statement made in the premise. Thus, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: Under condition (I), every multiplicative graph is an internal category.
Hypothesis: Under condition (I), every graph is an internal category.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifies that under a certain condition (condition I), every "multiplicative" graph qualifies as an internal category. The hypothesis generalizes this statement to every graph, without the qualifier "multiplicative". This implies a broadening of the category beyond what the premise specifically states. The hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise since it does not state that "multiplicative" graphs are not internal categories under condition (I); instead, it implies all graphs, not just "multiplicative" ones, are internal categories under the same condition. Therefore, since the hypothesis potentially includes more than what is stated in the premise without contradicting it, the relationship is neutral.

Hypothesis: We present an approach to Galois descent theory that has a categorical nature.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that a "simplified categorical approach to Galois descent theory" is described. This means that the approach being discussed is not only related to categories but is specifically centered around them, hence having a "categorical nature." The hypothesis conveys the same essential information, albeit phrased differently, by stating that an approach presented has a "categorical nature" to Galois descent theory. The alignment in the subject matter (Galois descent theory) and the emphasis on the categorical aspect in both sentences lead to the conclusion that the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise, thus establishing an entailment relationship.
----------

Premise: We describe a simplified categorical approach to Galois descent theory.
Hypothesis: We will not be concerned with Galois descent theory.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that a simplified categorical approach to Galois descent theory is described, indicating that the text does engage with Galois descent theory. The hypothesis directly opposes this by claiming that there will be no concern with Galois descent theory. This creates a direct contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis, as one states involvement with Galois descent theory, while the other denies any concern with it.
----------

Premise: We describe a simplified categorical approach to Galois descent theory.
Hypothesis: The previous categorical approach to Galois descent theory was correct, but convoluted.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise indicates that the approach being described is "simplified," which could imply that earlier methods were more complex or harder to understand. However, it does not explicitly state anything about the correctness or convoluted nature of previous approaches. Thus, saying the previous approach was "correct, but convoluted" introduces information not provided in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is neutral because the premise neither directly supports nor contradicts the hypothesis regarding the correctness and convoluted nature of the previous approach.

Premise: Now coproduct preservation yields an approach to product measures.
Hypothesis: Some approach to product measures results from coproduct preservation.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that coproduct preservation leads to an approach to product measures. The hypothesis rephrases this by suggesting that coproduct preservation results in an approach (or some approach) to product measures. Both the premise and the hypothesis agree that coproduct preservation has a result concerning product measures, with the hypothesis essentially reiterating the cause-and-effect relationship presented in the premise but in a slightly different phrasing. Thus, the information in the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, which is the definition of entailment.
----------

Premise: Now coproduct preservation yields an approach to product measures.
Hypothesis: Product measures are not related to coproduct preservation.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that "coproduct preservation yields an approach to product measures," directly implying that there is a relation between coproduct preservation and product measures. Given this, claiming that product measures are not related to coproduct preservation directly contradicts the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction.

Premise: Then we present three applications of groupoidification.
Hypothesis: We present at least two applications of groupoidification.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: Entailment

Reasoning: The premise explicitly mentions that three applications of groupoidification are presented. Given that three is more than two, the premise naturally entails that at least two applications are presented. Thus, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment, as the information in the premise directly supports the claim made in the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: Then we present three applications of groupoidification.
Hypothesis: Groupoidification is a purely theoretic concept that cannot be applied to anything.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise mentions presenting three applications of groupoidification, implying that groupoidification can indeed be applied in certain contexts or for specific purposes. The hypothesis states that groupoidification is a purely theoretic concept that cannot be applied to anything, which directly opposes the premise that outlines actual applications. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of contradiction, as they present mutually exclusive assertions.
----------

Premise: Then we present three applications of groupoidification.
Hypothesis: Two of the three applications that we present are well-known.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions the presentation of three applications of groupoidification but does not comment on the familiarity or recognition of these applications within any context. The hypothesis makes a specific claim about two of these three applications being well-known. Given that the premise provides no information on the novelty or recognizability of these applications, we cannot infer the truth or falsity of the hypothesis based on the information given in the premise. Therefore, the relationship is neutral because the hypothesis neither directly follows from nor contradicts the premise.
----------

Premise: The second application is to Hecke algebras.
Hypothesis: The second application involves some algebras.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions that the second application is to "Hecke algebras", directly implying that algebras are involved in the second application. Therefore, the hypothesis, which states that the second application involves some algebras, naturally follows from the premise. This establishes a clear relationship of entailment between the premise and the hypothesis since the premise provides enough information to affirm the claim made in the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: The second application is to Hecke algebras.
Hypothesis: Only one application exists.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions "The second application," which implies there is at least one other application (making a total of at least two). Therefore, the hypothesis stating "Only one application exists" directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.
----------

Premise: The second application is to Hecke algebras.
Hypothesis: Hall algebras can also be an application.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions that the second application is to Hecke algebras, but it doesn't discuss or mention Hall algebras. The fact that Hall algebras can also be an application does not directly contradict nor is it directly entailed by the statement about Hecke algebras since the premise doesn't address the scope or exclusivity of applications. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral because the hypothesis introduces a new idea that is not covered by the premise but also doesn't contradict it.

Premise: The ``if" directions fail for semi-abelian varieties.
Hypothesis: The ``if" directions cannot be proved for semi-abelian varieties.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that the "if" directions fail for semi-abelian varieties, which inherently means that they cannot be successfully proved or validated for semi-abelian varieties. The impossibility of proving the "if" directions as mentioned in the hypothesis is directly entailed by their failure described in the premise.
----------

Premise: The ``if" directions fail for semi-abelian varieties.
Hypothesis: The ``if" directions can be proved for semi-abelian varieties.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that the "if" directions fail for semi-abelian varieties, directly implying that these directions cannot be successfully proven or established for semi-abelian varieties. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims the exact opposite – that the "if" directions can indeed be proved for semi-abelian varieties. The direct opposition in the statements leads to the judgment of contradiction between them.
----------

Premise: The ``if" directions fail for semi-abelian varieties.
Hypothesis: The ``only if" directions fail for semi-abelian varieties.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions that the "if" directions fail for semi-abelian varieties, but it does not provide information about the "only if" directions. Since the hypothesis focuses on the "only if" directions failing, without information from the premise to directly support or contradict this, the relationship is neutral. The premise and hypothesis discuss two different aspects, and without explicit information linking the failure of one to the implication about the other, we cannot infer entailment or contradiction.

Premise: We compute some simple examples and explore the elementary properties of these invariants.
Hypothesis: We will be concerned with some properties of certain invariants.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise involves the process of computing simple examples and exploring elementary properties of invariants. The hypothesis reflects a future intent (indicated by "will be") to be concerned with properties of certain invariants. The specific work described in the premise (exploring properties of invariants) directly supports or entails the broader, more general intent described in the hypothesis (concern with some properties of certain invariants). Thus, the more detailed actions of computing and exploring in the premise imply a concern for the properties of invariants, as stated in the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: We compute some simple examples and explore the elementary properties of these invariants.
Hypothesis: We compute some simple examples of these invariants, but we will not be concerned with their properties.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that both examples of the invariants are computed and their properties are explored. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by stating that there is no concern with the properties of these invariants. Thus, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction, as both statements cannot be true at the same time.
----------

Premise: We compute some simple examples and explore the elementary properties of these invariants.
Hypothesis: We explore the elementary properties of these invariants and prove that no other invariants exist.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions computing some simple examples and exploring the elementary properties of these invariants. However, it does not address whether other invariants exist or not. The hypothesis introduces an additional claim that no other invariants exist beyond those explored, which is new information not contained within the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral because the hypothesis adds information that is neither supported nor contradicted by the premise.
----------

Premise: Symbolic dynamics is partly the study of walks in a directed graph.
Hypothesis: The study of walks in a directed graph is related to symbolic dynamics.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "Symbolic dynamics is partly the study of walks in a directed graph". This means that within the domain of symbolic dynamics, one aspect or part of the research or studies undertaken involves the examination or investigation of walks in directed graphs. When the hypothesis mentions "The study of walks in a directed graph is related to symbolic dynamics", it is directly affirming that conducting studies or investigations into walks within directed graphs has a relationship or connection to the field of symbolic dynamics. Given that the premise explicitly includes the study of walks in directed graphs as a component of symbolic dynamics, it directly supports the claim made in the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment, as the premise provides direct support for the assertion made in the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: Symbolic dynamics is partly the study of walks in a directed graph.
Hypothesis: It is not known whether symbolic dynamics can be connected to graph theory.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that symbolic dynamics involves the study of walks in a directed graph, which is a concept within graph theory. Therefore, it is already established that symbolic dynamics has a connection to graph theory. The hypothesis, however, states that it is not known whether such a connection exists, directly contradicting the information provided in the premise.
----------

Premise: Symbolic dynamics is partly the study of walks in a directed graph.
Hypothesis: Symbolic dynamics is partly the study of strolls in a directed graph.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise discusses symbolic dynamics as "partly the study of walks in a directed graph," whereas the hypothesis substitutes "walks" with "strolls". In mathematics and related fields, terminology is precise, and while "walks" and "strolls" might be considered synonyms in everyday language, the specific term used in the context of symbolic dynamics is "walks." Thus, without further context indicating that "strolls" has the same technical meaning as "walks," we cannot determine if the hypothesis accurately rephrases the premise or subtly shifts its meaning. Therefore, the relationship here is neutral because the hypothesis might introduce a nuanced or colloquial interpretation not explicitly aligned with or contradicting the premise.
----------

Premise: To each graph we associate a basal graph, well defined up to isomorphism.
Hypothesis: A basal graph can be associated with each graph.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that for every graph, there is a corresponding basal graph that is well defined up to isomorphism. The hypothesis rephrases this idea by saying that a basal graph can be associated with each graph. Both the premise and hypothesis convey the possibility of associating a basal graph with each graph, although the premise adds information about the uniqueness of this association "up to isomorphism." Since the core assertion of an association between graphs and basal graphs is present in both the premise and hypothesis, the relationship is entailment.
----------

Premise: To each graph we associate a basal graph, well defined up to isomorphism.
Hypothesis: While it is possible to assign a basal graph to each graph, this correspondence is never well defined.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that to each graph, a basal graph is well defined up to isomorphism, which implies there is a clear and recognized way of defining the correspondence between a graph and its basal graph, albeit allowing for isomorphic variations. The hypothesis directly contradicts this by claiming that this correspondence is never well defined, suggesting there is no clear way to establish this relationship. Thus, the hypothesis negates the core assertion of the premise, leading to the label of contradiction.
----------

Premise: To each graph we associate a basal graph, well defined up to isomorphism.
Hypothesis: To each graph we associate a basal graph, well defined up to a unique isomorphism.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that each graph is associated with a basal graph "well defined up to isomorphism," which implies there may be multiple isomorphisms that can define the basal graph equivalently. The hypothesis adds the condition of "up to a unique isomorphism," suggesting there is exactly one specific isomorphism for each graph-basal graph association. This addition of uniqueness changes the condition from that stated in the premise and introduces a specificity not implied by the premise. Because the premise does not exclude the possibility of a unique isomorphism but does not assert it either, the statement is neither directly supported (entailment) nor contradicted. Hence, the relation is neutral; the hypothesis and premise differ in specificity about the uniqueness of the isomorphism, but the hypothesis does not necessarily contradict or entail the premise's claim.
----------

Premise: We combine two recent ideas: cartesian differential categories, and restriction categories.
Hypothesis: The combination of restriction categories and cartesian differential categories is impossible.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly mentions that "two recent ideas: cartesian differential categories, and restriction categories" are combined. This directly contradicts the hypothesis statement that says the combination of these two categories is impossible. Since the premise indicates that not only is the combination possible but it has been accomplished, this directly opposes the claim made in the hypothesis, leading to a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We combine two recent ideas: cartesian differential categories, and restriction categories.
Hypothesis: Cartesian differential categories and restriction categories re concepts in categorical logic.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that two recent ideas, cartesian differential categories and restriction categories, are combined in some context. However, it does not specify the domain or field to which these ideas belong. The hypothesis posits that both cartesian differential categories and restriction categories are concepts in categorical logic. While these areas may indeed relate to categorical logic, the premise doesn't explicitly mention their application or relevance to categorical logic. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, as the premise neither confirms nor denies the claim made in the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: The category of Set-valued presheaves on a small category B is a topos.
Hypothesis: The category of Set-valued presheaves on a category B is a topos.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifies that B is a "small" category, while the hypothesis omits this specification and refers to any category B without the "small" qualification. The attribute of being "small" might be a technical requirement for the category of Set-valued presheaves on B to be a topos, and without it, we can't definitively say the same applies to any category B, regardless of its size or other qualifications. Therefore, we cannot imply that the statement about any category B being a topos directly follows from the statement about a "small" category being a topos, making the relationship between the two statements neutral.

Premise: A flow on a compact Hausdorff space is an automorphism.
Hypothesis: A flow on a compact Hausdorff space is an endomorphism.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: An automorphism is a special case of an endomorphism, where the function is indeed an isomorphism (i.e., bijective with an inverse that is also a morphism). Therefore, if a flow on a compact Hausdorff space is asserted to be an automorphism (a bijective endomorphism), it automatically qualifies as an endomorphism, because every automorphism by definition is an endomorphism. Hence, the premise entails the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: A flow on a compact Hausdorff space is an automorphism.
Hypothesis: No flow on a compact Hausdorff space is an automorphism.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that a flow on a compact Hausdorff space is an automorphism, which means at least one flow exists that is an automorphism. The hypothesis directly negates this by claiming that no flow on a compact Hausdorff space is an automorphism. Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis are in direct contradiction with each other.
----------

Premise: A flow on a compact Hausdorff space is an automorphism.
Hypothesis: A flow on a Hausdorff space is an automorphism
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifies that the flow is on a "compact Hausdorff space" and results in an automorphism, while the hypothesis removes the condition of compactness and simply states that a flow on a Hausdorff space is an automorphism. The compactness of the space might influence the nature of the flow and its classification as an automorphism. Given that the hypothesis omits this condition, it doesn't directly contradict the premise but neither does it fully entail it since the scenarios described are not identical. The presence or absence of compactness could significantly affect the validity of the statement about automorphisms. Therefore, the relationship is neutral: the hypothesis could be true under certain conditions, but it's not inherently guaranteed or contradicted by the premise.

Premise: Vertical arrows give rise to modules between representables.
Hypothesis: Some arrows give rise to modules between representables.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that "Vertical arrows give rise to modules between representables," which implies that there exists at least some subset of arrows (specifically, vertical arrows) that accomplishes this. The hypothesis posits that "Some arrows give rise to modules between representables," which directly aligns with the premise by acknowledging the existence of such arrows that lead to the outcome described. The specification of "vertical arrows" in the premise ensures that the hypothesis's more general claim of "some arrows" is necessarily true, leading to an entailment relationship.
----------

Premise: Vertical arrows give rise to modules between representables.
Hypothesis: Modules between representables have no interaction with vertical arrows.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise indicates that vertical arrows are responsible for the creation or existence of modules between representables, implying that there is a relationship or interaction between vertical arrows and these modules. By stating that modules between representables have no interaction with vertical arrows, the hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.

Premise: Various concerns suggest looking for internal co-categories in categories with strong logical structure.
Hypothesis: We looked for internal co-categories with strong logical structure.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise mentions that "concerns suggest looking for internal co-categories in categories with strong logical structure", which indicates an action (looking for internal co-categories) motivated by certain concerns within a specific context (categories with strong logical structure). The hypothesis states "We looked for internal co-categories with strong logical structure", essentially reiterating the action and context mentioned in the premise without adding or subtracting any conditions. This alignment of the action described in both the premise and the hypothesis logically leads to an entailment relationship, as the action taken in the hypothesis directly follows the suggestion made in the premise.
----------

Premise: Various concerns suggest looking for internal co-categories in categories with strong logical structure.
Hypothesis: We abandon the idea of looking for internal co-categories in categories with a strong logical structure.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise implies that there is an interest or consideration towards exploring or identifying internal co-categories within categories characterized by strong logical structure. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the pursuit or idea of identifying or exploring internal co-categories in such categories is being abandoned. These two statements have opposing implications – one indicates an active interest while the other indicates a retreat or discontinuation from that line of inquiry. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is contradiction, as they present mutually exclusive actions regarding the investigation into internal co-categories within logically structured categories.

Premise: We give a new proof of the fact that every topos is adhesive.
Hypothesis: We give a proof that each topos is adhesive.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states that a new proof is given for the fact that every topos is adhesive. The hypothesis simplifies this statement to a proof being given that each topos is adhesive. Since "every" and "each" are synonymous in this context, and the hypothesis does not add, subtract, or modify the core assertion related to the existence and subject of the proof, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is one of entailment. Both statements assert the provision of proof concerning the adhesiveness of topoi without implying any difference in the nature or scope of the proof provided.
----------

Premise: We give a new proof of the fact that every topos is adhesive.
Hypothesis: We give a new proof that every topos is non-adhesive.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that a new proof has been given to support the fact that every topos is adhesive. Meanwhile, the hypothesis directly opposes this by claiming a new proof has been given that every topos is non-adhesive. Because the assertion made in the hypothesis directly contradicts the assertion made in the premise, the relationship between them is one of contradiction.
----------

Premise: We give a new proof of the fact that every topos is adhesive.
Hypothesis: The old proof of the fact that every topos is adhesive had gaps.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that a new proof was given for the fact that every topos is adhesive, but it does not directly comment on the quality, completeness, or validity of any previous or old proofs regarding the same fact. The hypothesis suggests there were gaps in the old proof, which could potentially be a reason for presenting a new proof, but such a connection is not explicitly made in the premise. It's possible to present a new proof for reasons other than correcting gaps, such as offering a simpler argument, using new techniques, or providing a more general framework. Therefore, without explicit information linking the new proof to the deficiencies of the old proof, the relationship is neutral.

Hypothesis: We have several definitions of "the category of smooth objects".
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise implies the presence of multiple, distinct definitions of "the category of smooth objects" which they compare. The act of comparing "various different definitions" directly entails that there are "several definitions" of the same concept being considered, thus fulfilling the statement made in the hypothesis.
----------

Premise: We compare various different definitions of "the category of smooth objects".
Hypothesis: No one has given a definition of "the category of smooth objects".
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise indicates that there are various different definitions of "the category of smooth objects" being compared, which directly contradicts the hypothesis that claims no definition of "the category of smooth objects" has been provided. The premise implies that multiple definitions exist, while the hypothesis asserts that none exist, making the relationship between them a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We compare various different definitions of "the category of smooth objects".
Hypothesis: No one has given a definition of "the bicategory of smooth objects".
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise discusses comparisons among various definitions of "the category of smooth objects," implying that multiple definitions exist for this concept specifically within the realm of categories. However, the hypothesis shifts focus to the concept of "the bicategory of smooth objects," making a claim about the absence of definitions for this slightly different concept. Since the premise does not address bicategories, it cannot directly contradict or entail the claim made in the hypothesis about the non-existence of definitions for bicategories. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral; the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis due to the difference in the concepts being discussed (categories vs. bicategories).

Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise says, "We indicate also some possible novel geometric interest in such algebras," which means that they are pointing out or suggesting that there could be new areas of geometric interest related to the mentioned algebras. The hypothesis simplifies this to, "We suggest some novel geometric interest in such algebras," essentially capturing the essence of the premise by indicating that the authors are proposing or suggesting there is new geometric relevance in these algebras. Both statements convey the idea that there is an introduction or proposal of new geometric interest in the algebras, making the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis one of entailment.

Hypothesis: We fail to see any possible geometric interest in such algebras.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise suggests that there is an indication of possible novel geometric interest in certain algebras, meaning the authors see potential value or interest in the algebras from a geometric perspective. The hypothesis directly negates this by stating that the authors fail to see any possible geometric interest, implying there is no value or interest seen in these algebras from a geometric perspective. This direct opposition in views between the premise and the hypothesis establishes a contradiction.
----------

Premise: We indicate also some possible novel geometric interest in such algebras.
Hypothesis: We suggest some novel geometric interest in such coalgebras.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise specifically mentions "some possible novel geometric interest in such algebras," while the hypothesis shifts the focus to "such coalgebras." The subtle change from "algebras" to "coalgebras" means that while both sentences talk about suggesting or indicating novel geometric interests, the distinction between algebras and coalgebras (which are distinct concepts in mathematics) makes it so that one cannot definitively state that the premise entails or contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship is neutral because the change in terms could mean covering different, albeit related, areas of interest, without direct affirmation or negation of the premise by the hypothesis.

Hypothesis: We give a proof of this result.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise specifies that a new, elementary proof of a result will be provided in the paper. The hypothesis simplifies this to stating that a proof of the result is given. Since providing a "new, elementary" proof is an instance of giving a proof, the hypothesis is directly entailed by the premise. It does not matter how the proof is characterized (new, old, elementary, complex); the fundamental point is that a proof is given, which is exactly what the hypothesis states.

Premise: In this paper we will give a new, elementary proof of this result.
Hypothesis: In this paper we give the old, original proof of this result.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise clearly states that a "new, elementary proof" of a result will be provided in the paper. The hypothesis directly contradicts this statement by claiming that the "old, original proof" is given instead. Since these two assertions cannot both be true in the context of the same paper, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a contradiction.

Premise: In this paper we will give a new, elementary proof of this result.
Hypothesis: In this paper we will give a number=theoretic proof of this result.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise mentions giving a "new, elementary proof" of a result. However, this does not specify the nature or field of the proof. The hypothesis suggests that the paper will provide a "number-theoretic proof." Since the premise does not mention the specific field of the proof — only that it will be "elementary" — it's possible that the paper's proof could be number-theoretic, but it's not necessarily so based solely on the information given in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral, because the premise neither entails nor contradicts the specific claim that the proof will be number-theoretic.

Hypothesis: We provide details of that work.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise states "We clarify details of that work," which implies that the authors are making aspects of "that work" clear, likely by providing or explaining details. The hypothesis states "We provide details of that work," which aligns with the action of clarifying by providing details. Thus, the premise entails the hypothesis since clarifying details inherently involves providing them.
----------

Premise: We clarify details of that work.
Hypothesis: That work cannot be clarified.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise explicitly states that "We clarify details of that work," indicating that clarification is indeed possible and has been undertaken. On the other hand, the hypothesis asserts "That work cannot be clarified," which directly opposes the premise by claiming clarification is impossible. This direct opposition between the possibility and impossibility of clarification establishes a contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis.

Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise states that details of "that work" are being clarified, which suggests a broader discussion or review of the work in question. The hypothesis, however, specifies giving details of a "special case" of that work. The hypothesis narrows down the scope to a particular aspect or instance within the broader discussion mentioned in the premise. Since the premise does not explicitly mention focusing on special cases, nor does it exclude them, the relationship is neutral. There is no direct implication that clarifying details of the work necessarily includes or excludes discussing details of a special case.

Reasoning: The premise states that "Our main conceptual tool is a monad on the category of grouped toposes," and the hypothesis rephrases this by saying, "We use as a conceptual tool a monad on the category of grouped toposes." Both the premise and the hypothesis are discussing the use of a monad on the category of grouped toposes as a conceptual tool, merely using different structures to express the same idea. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, making the relationship between the two an entailment.

Reasoning: The premise talks about employing a "monad on the category of grouped toposes" as the main conceptual tool. The hypothesis mentions a more specific application or area of investigation, focusing on "isotropy and the Clifford sequence" within a topos-theoretic framework. The premise does not specifically mention isotropy, Clifford sequences, or even the focus on topos-theoretic investigations directly related to these topics. Therefore, without explicit evidence that using a monad on the category of grouped toposes necessarily involves an investigation of isotropy and the Clifford sequence, we cannot infer an entailment or contradiction. The absence of a direct link between the conceptual tool described in the premise and the specific investigation outlined in the hypothesis suggests a neutral relationship, as one does not directly imply or contradict the other within the information provided.

Premise: We also discuss some new examples and results motivated by this characterization.
Hypothesis: We discuss this characterization.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The hypothesis states that there is a discussion about this characterization, which is directly supported by the premise that mentions discussing new examples and results motivated by the characterization. Thus, the premise logically entails that the characterization is being discussed, aligning perfectly with the claim made in the hypothesis.

Premise: We also discuss some new examples and results motivated by this characterization.
Hypothesis: We refrain from discussing examples and results motivated by this characterization.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise states that "We also discuss some new examples and results motivated by this characterization," while the hypothesis states the opposite by claiming "We refrain from discussing examples and results motivated by this characterization." This clear opposition between the discussion and the refraining from discussing specific examples and results signifies a contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis.

Premise: We also discuss some new examples and results motivated by this characterization.
Hypothesis: We also discuss new functors motivated by this characterization.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: Neutral

Reasoning: The premise talks about discussing "some new examples and results" motivated by a certain characterization, but it does not specifically mention discussing "new functors". Since functors could potentially be part of the examples and results, or they might not be, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is neutral. There is not enough information to definitively say that discussing new examples and results entails discussing new functors, nor is there a direct contradiction.

Premise: It also gives an easy way to calculate the sources and targets of opetopes.
Hypothesis: This gives a way to calculate the sources of opetopes.
Label: entailment
Machine_label: entailment
Machine_reasoning: Label: entailment

Reasoning: The premise mentions an "easy way to calculate the sources and targets of opetopes." The hypothesis focuses on a subset of this statement, specifically on calculating the sources of opetopes, which is directly included in the premise's statement. Therefore, if the premise provides a way to calculate both the sources and targets, it necessarily provides a way to calculate just the sources. Thus, the relationship is `entailment`.

Premise: It also gives an easy way to calculate the sources and targets of opetopes
Hypothesis: This gives a hard way to calculate the sources and targets of opetopes.
Label: contradiction
Machine_label: contradiction
Machine_reasoning: Label: contradiction

Reasoning: The premise describes the method as an "easy way to calculate the sources and targets of opetopes," while the hypothesis directly contradicts this by referring to it as a "hard way" to do the same task. These statements offer directly opposing descriptions of the difficulty level of the calculation process, thus the relationship is a contradiction.
----------

Premise: It also gives an easy way to calculate the sources and targets of opetopes
Hypothesis: It also gives an easy way to calculate the sources and targets of polytopes.
Label: neutral
Machine_label: neutral
Machine_reasoning: Label: neutral

Reasoning: The premise and hypothesis are discussing the calculation of sources and targets for different geometrical entities, opetopes, and polytopes, respectively. Since opetopes and polytopes are not synonymous (with opetopes being specific higher-dimensional shapes used in higher category theory and polytopes being more general geometric figures that can exist in various dimensions), the statement in the hypothesis does not directly follow from nor contradicts the premise. This suggests a neutral relationship because the hypothesis neither aligns with nor directly opposes the premise; it simply shifts the focus to another type of entity without indicating whether the method for calculating sources and targets would work for both.
